# Streamflow {#E2_1 -}

In this module we understand how to generate streamflow data, and then how to charcaterise variability in streamflow data.

## Measuring Stream Velocity & Discharge {#E2_2 -}

The process of measuring stream flow (volume rate of flow), or discharge, is called stream
gauging. There are numerous methods of stream gauging, including direct methods, such as volumetric gauging, and dilution methods, as well as indirect methods involving stage-discharge relations, or rating curves. Since the velocity of a stream varies with depth and width across a stream, it is important to understand what it is you want to measure when choosing a stream gauging method. If you are interested in stream surface velocity, a simple float method would work well. This method involves throwing some buoyant, highly visible object into the stream and measuring the time it takes to float a known distance. If you are interested in obtaining a more accurate stream discharge measurement, the velocity-area method is your method of choice. 

Stream flow (discharge) can be measured based on two fundamental methods, which are each expanded upon below (refer to lecture 3 for details). The first requires a direct measurement of velocity, whereas the second is an approximation based on stream-bed slope and geometry. 

### Flow Rate: Velocity-Area Method {#E2_3 -}

Flow estimates in natural streams and artificial channels under steady (no change in depth with time) and uniform (no change in depth with space) conditions can be computed by the product of mean flow velocity (integrated in depth and across the channel) and the cross-sectional area of flow. The equation $Q = V * A$, were $V$ (m/s) is the mean velocity and $A$ (m^2^) is the flow (or water) cross-sectional area is used for this purpose. Large streams and rivers, a section control is needed to generate the “rating curve” thus establishing a relationship between water stage height ($H$) and flow discharge ($Q$). In this case, both flow velocity measurements and cross-sectional areas are needed.

Discharge using the Velocity-Area method is measured by integrating the area and velocity of each point across the stream. The channel or stream is divided into sections based on where the velocity and stage height measurements were taken in the cross-section of the stream/channel. The flow velocity is measured using a current meter (i.e. propeller, electromagnetic, ultrasonic, and Doppler). 

The discharge is computed using:

<center>
\begin{equation}
Q = \sum^{n}_{i=0} (V_{i} * \text{Area}_{i})
(\#eq:exercise2-1)
\end{equation}
</center>

where $n$ is the number of vertical for measuring velocities, $V_{i}$ is the mean velocity value for vertical $i$ (m/s) and $\text{Area}_i$ is the cross-sectional area around vertical $i$ (m^2^). The cross-sectional area is best estimated by treating the sections as rectangles, trapezia or triangles.

```{r image03-1, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Current-meter discharge measurements are made by determining the discharge in each subsection of a channel cross section and summing the subsection discharges to obtain a total discharge.", out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/surface_hydrology/picture1.png")
```
</center>

To measure stream velocity we can utilise a “**swoffer**” – a pole with a propeller on the end with an electronic logger recording the rotations. A current meter is so designed that its rotation speed varies linearly with the stream velocity at the location of the instrument. 

A more modern alternative is an “ADV” (Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter). This relies on a method where it looks at the scatter of sound waves rebounding of particles/bubbles in the water, and based on the “Doppler effect” (recall the sound of a train changing pitch as it moves past you), it can compute the water velocity.

### Flow Rate: Manning’s Formula {#E2_4 -}

Manning’s formula for estimating runoff (in m^3^s^-1^) from basic channel geometry, slope and roughness is: 

<center>
\begin{equation}
Q = \frac{1}{n}(A\space{}R^{\frac{2}{3}}\space{}S^{\frac{1}{2}})
(\#eq:exercise2-2)
\end{equation}
</center>

Where: $A$ is the channel cross-sectional area (m^2^) ; $R$ is the hydraulic radius given by $\frac{A}{P}$ ; $P$ is the wetted perimeter (i.e. bed plus banks; m); $S$ is the channel slope (m/m); $n$ is Manning’s ‘n’ (which is an empirical roughness coefficient).

In the field:

- The bottom slope ($S$) will be estimated by using a differential GPS (DGPS). Conduct this by averaging the slope (m/m) for two reaches, one upstream and one downstream of the measurement point 
- Estimate the ‘wetted perimeter’ ($P$) of the channel and cross sectional area ($A$) 
- The roughness coefficient ($n$) should be assumed from the literature, based on your observations and using a photograph of the channel. Then use the table below:

## Making Sense of Streamflow Data  {#E2_5 -}

<center>
```{r image03-5, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="[The Avon River, Western Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avon_River_(Western_Australia))", out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/surface_hydrology/picture5.jpeg")
```
</center>

The first step in any hydrologic data analysis project is to gather the data and relevant background information on your catchment of interest. In Western Australia the [WIR website](http://wir.water.wa.gov.au/Pages/Water-Information-Reporting.aspx) contains all of the data and information you need, and we will use this in our future assignments. All states/countries have something similar; the USA has one of the best examples through the [USGS NWIS website](http://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis).  

If you click the site information button, enter your gage name or number, and browse the available datasets for your river. For this analysis, you will need daily discharge data, peak streamflow, and the annual water data report. Other datasets may also be helpful for understanding the hydrologic behavior of your river. 

Hydrologic analyses are almost always conducted for "water years" not calendar years. In the Northern Hemisphere. A water year begins on October 1 and ends September 30 . In the Southern Hemisphere it Starts May 1 and ends April 30, though this can be region specific.

**Activity:** Go to the [WIR web link](http://wir.water.wa.gov.au/Pages/Water-Information-Reporting.aspx), and download the continuous flow data for the Swan River "Walyunga" gauge (616011). In Excel, explore the data. Create a hydrograph comparing discharge between a wet year and a dry year (i.e. plot two years on a common x-axis. Use "hydrologic years" rather than calendar years. Label accordingly.
Repeat the exercise but this time creating a unit hydrograph - for this you will need to divide by the catchment area; refer to the above information and check units are consistent. This gauge is draining the Avon catchment

### Daily Unit Discharge Hydrograph {#E2_6 -}

Unit discharge is the total discharge of the river divided by the watershed area. Thus, it has units of m^3^/s/km^2^. Unit discharge is very useful for comparing the hydrologic behaviour of catchments of different size (since discharge scales with area). Depending on your data source you will need to download data and do appropriate conversions in a spreadsheet. 

A properly formatted unit discharge hydrograph (Figure 1) has a descriptive title, labelled axes, and a logarithmic y-axis. If you need help with formatting the graph in Excel, please don't hesitate to ask for help! 


### Flow Duration Curves {#E2_7 -}

#### What is it? {#E2_8 -}

The flow duration curve is a plot that shows the percentage of time that flow in a stream is likely to equal or exceed some specified value of interest. For example, it can be used to show the percentage of time river flow can be expected to exceed a design flow of some specified value (e.g., 20 m^3^/s), or to show the discharge of the stream that occurs or is exceeded some percent of the time (e.g., 80% of the time). 

#### How is it calculated? {#E2_9 -}

The basic time unit used in preparing a flow-duration curve will greatly affect its appearance. For most studies, mean daily discharges are used. These will give a steep curve. When the mean flow over a long period is used (such as mean monthly flow), the resulting curve will be flatter due to averaging of short-term peaks with intervening smaller flows during a month. Extreme values are averaged out more and more, as the time period gets larger (e.g., for a flow duration curve based on annual flows at a long-record station). 

**Step 1:** Sort (rank) average daily discharges for period of record from the largest value to the smallest value, involving a total of $n$ values. 

**Step 2:** Assign each discharge value a rank ($M$), starting with 1 for the largest daily discharge value.

**Step 3:** Calculate exceedence probability ($P$) as follows:

<center>
\begin{equation}
P = 100 * [\frac{M}{n+1}]
(\#eq:exercise2-3)
\end{equation}
</center>

Where, $P$ = the probability that a given flow will be equaled or exceeded (% of time), $M$ = the ranked position on the listing (dimensionless), and $n$ = the number of events for period of record (dimensionless). 

#### What does this particular information tell you about your stream? {#E2_10 -}

A flow duration curve characterizes the ability of the basin to provide flows of various
magnitudes. Information concerning the relative amount of time that flows past a site are likely to equal or exceed a specified value of interest is extremely useful for the design of structures on a stream. For example, a structure can be designed to perform well within some range of flows, such as flows that occur between 20 and 80% of the time (or some other selected interval). 

The shape of a flow-duration curve in its upper and lower regions is particularly significant in evaluating the stream and basin characteristics. The shape of the curve in the high-flow region indicates the type of flood regime the basin is likely to have, whereas, the shape of the low-flow region characterizes the ability of the basin to sustain low flows during dry seasons. A very steep curve (high flows for short periods) would be expected for rain-caused floods on small watersheds. Snowmelt floods, which last for several days, or regulation of floods with reservoir storage, will generally result in a much flatter curve near the upper limit. In the low-flow region, an intermittent stream would exhibit periods of no flow, whereas, a very flat curve indicates that moderate flows are sustained throughout the year due to natural or artificial streamflow regulation, or due to a large groundwater capacity which sustains the base flow to the stream. 

An example, properly formatted flow duration curve is shown below (Figure xxx). 

### Flood Frequency Analysis {#E2_11 -}

#### What is it?  {#E2_12 -}

Flood frequency analyses are used to predict design floods for sites along a river. The technique involves using observed annual peak flow discharge data to calculate statistical information such as mean values, standard deviations, skewness, and recurrence intervals. These statistical data are then used to construct frequency distributions, which are graphs and tables that tell the **likelihood** of various discharges as a function of recurrence interval or exceedence probability. 

Flood frequency distributions can take on many forms according to the equations used to carry out the statistical analyses. Four of the common forms are: **Normal Distribution**; **Log-Normal Distribution**; **Gumbel Distribution**; and **Log-Pearson Type III Distribution**. Each distribution can be used to predict design floods; however, there are advantages and disadvantages of each technique. 

While the log Pearson Type III distribution is the recommended technique, its application is a bit more complex than we are going to undertake for this class. Instead, we will use the older Weibull plotting position method. 

Flood frequency information can be determined from knowledge of the peak discharge (highest discharge) in any given year provided enough years of information has been collected.  This allows one to relate the expected recurrence interval for a given discharge, and determine the probability that a flood of a given discharge will occur in any given year.  The recurrence interval for a given discharge can be calculated by first ranking the discharges.  

In Table \@ref(tab:table03-1) below for “Big River”, fill in the Rank column.  To do this, enter a 1 for the maximum discharge that has occurred during the 20 years of available data. The second highest discharge will be given a rank of 2, etc. with the lowest discharge given a value of 20.
<br>

<center>
```{r table03-1, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
options(kableExtra.html.bsTable = F, knitr.kable.NA = '')
table1 <- read.csv("tables/surface_hydrology/table1.csv", check.names=FALSE)
kable(table1,"html", escape = F, align = rep('c'), caption = "Complete the table for 'Big River'",
      bootstrap_options = "hover") %>%
  kable_styling(table1, bootstrap_options = "hover", "striped", 
                full_width = F, position = "center",
                font_size = 12) %>%
  column_spec(1, width_min = "15em") %>%
  column_spec(2, width_min = "15em") %>%
  column_spec(3, width_min = "15em") %>%
  column_spec(4, width_min = "15em") %>%
  row_spec(1:20, background = 'white') %>%
  scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "515px",
             fixed_thead = FALSE) 
```
</center>
<br>
After you have filled in the Rank column, you can now calculate the recurrence interval for each peak discharge.  The recurrence interval, $R$, is given by the Weibull Equation:

<center>
\begin{equation}
R = \frac{n+1}{m}
(\#eq:exercise2-4)
\end{equation}
</center>

Where $n$ is the number of years over which the data was collected (20 years in this case), and $m$ is the rank of each peak discharge.  Use this equation to calculate the recurrence interval for each peak discharge. 

Next, use the graph below to plot a graph of discharge (on the y-axis) versus recurrence interval (on the x-axis).  Note that the x-axis is a logarithmic scale, and thus you should try to estimate as best you can where the data point will fall between the lines on the graph. Once you have plotted the points use a ruler to draw the best fit straight line through the data points (lay a ruler on the graph and try to draw a line that most closely approximates all of the data points). Do not draw lines that connect individual data points.  

<center>
```{r image03-4, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width = '70%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/surface_hydrology/picture4.png")
```
</center>

By extrapolating your line on the graph, determine the peak discharge expected in a flood with a recurrence interval of 50 years and 100 years.  These are the discharges expected in a 50 year flood and a 100 year flood. 

The annual exceedence probability, $P_{e}$, is the probability that a given discharge will occur in a given year.  It is calculated as the inverse of the recurrence interval, $R$:

<center>
\begin{equation}
P_{e} = \frac{1}{R}
(\#eq:exercise2-5)
\end{equation}
</center>

Thus, the probability that a flood with a 10 year recurrence interval will occur in any year is 1/10 = 0.1 or 10%.  What are the probabilities that a 50 year flood and a 100 year flood will occur in any given year?
