["E1-1.html", "Exercise 1: Catchment Rainfall and Runoff Part 1: Spatial Rainfall Variability Part 2: Rainfall and Runoff Data Analysis", " Exercise 1: Catchment Rainfall and Runoff Part 1: Spatial Rainfall Variability Introduction Many factors affect the extent to which the measured rainfall amount at one rain-gauge can be extended to the surrounding area: the distance from the rain-gauge to the centre of the representative area, the size of the area, the topography, the nature of the rainfall quantity (storm event, daily, monthly), the characteristics of the local storm patterns (convective versus low intensity events). Most hydrological analysis at the catchment scale requires knowledge of the areal distribution of precipitation in the form of an average depth (mm) of water for the entire catchment over a specified time period, using information from a set of unevenly placed rain-gauges spread around the area. In order to calculate the flow discharge produced by a large storm (convective type) in the catchment in, it is necessary to calculate the average depth of rainfall (ADR) over the catchment. Three approaches are currently used for estimating the total rainfall: an arithmetic average of gauged quantities, the isohyetal method, and the Thiessen polygon method. In this exercise you will compare these three different approaches for calculating the ADR and runoff generated by a single rainfall event. To annotate this page, make sure you do so in the ‘Hydrology Class 2020’ group - you can join it here. Download the answer sheet for this exercise by clicking the download button in the tool bar . Methods In this exercise you are required to calculate the average rainfall (ADR) over the entire catchment using: the arithmetic mean (considering only stations within the catchment boundary), the Thiessen polygon weighting system, and the Isohyetal method. Rainfall data for each station in the catchment is provide in Table 3. You are then required to produce an estimate of catchment runoff, which we will assume is equal to the stream discharge out of the catchment (\\(Q\\)). Recall from lecture slides that a rough estimate of runoff may be estimated using the total rainfall over the catchment during a given period of time, and a runoff coefficient. Figure 1: A depth of rain (\\(P\\), mm/day) is falling over a catchment area (\\(A\\), km2) to produce stream discharge (\\(Q\\), m3/day). Arithmetic Average The most basic measure of average rainfall depth is the arthimetic average, whereby you sum the observed rainfall at each rain gauge inside the catchment and divide by the number of gauges. Theisson Polygon Method The average depth of rainfall (ADR) over the entire catchment can be calculated using: \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathrm{ADR\\ (mm)\\ =\\ }\\frac{\\sum{A_i\\ast P_i}}{\\sum A_i} \\tag{1} \\end{equation}\\] Where \\(A_{i}\\) is the polygon area (km2), \\(P_{i}\\) is the rainfall (mm) corresponding to the \\(i\\) polygon, and \\(\\sum{A_{i}}\\) is the catchment area (km2). Isohyetal Method The average depth of rainfall over the entire catchment can be calculated using: \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathrm{ADR\\ (mm)\\ =\\ }\\frac{\\sum{A_i\\ast P_i}}{\\sum A_i} \\tag{2} \\end{equation}\\] where in this method \\(A_{i}\\) is the area between isohyets \\(P_{i}\\) and \\(P_{i+1}\\) (km2), \\(P_{i}\\) is the average rainfall (mm) corresponding to the area \\(A_{i}\\) between the isohyets, and \\(\\sum{A_{i}}\\) is the total catchment area (km2). Activity You are given the measured data for each rainfall gauge in Table 1. Calculate the arithmetic mean and write this in your summary table (Table 3). Next work out the ADR based on the other two methods. Once we have computed ADR, we can now estimate the likely amount of runoff. Remember the relationship between rainfall and discharge as outlined in the lecture. You’ll need to choose an appropriate runoff coefficient, and calculate the stream discharge at the bottom of the catchment - rember to watch out for unit conversions! (8 marks).

Thiessen Polygons: Sketch the polygons To construct the Thiessen polygons, first draw dashed straight lines between the gauges. Next, find the mid-points of each of these lines and draw another solid line, perpendicular to the dashed line. These solid lines drawn perpendicular to the dashed lines will meet to form irregular polygons Figure 3: Gridded map for polygon construction and area estimates.

You should always go back to your original objectives (or aims) and see what you have learnt from your analysis. Do this now and briefly summarise the aims of this exercise, your conclusions after doing this analysis, the limitations of your approach, and any recommendations. The aim(s) of this exercise was (2 marks): After doing this exercise I have been able to conclude (4 marks): Limitations, assumptions and sources of error (4 marks): Based on this study I would recommend (3 marks): Part 2: Rainfall and Runoff Data Analysis Introduction The previous exercise focussed on estimating rainfall and runoff at catchment scales during a storm event. This focussed on catchment scale rainfall and processes. In this exercise we will examine the nature of rainfall data and use some simple statistics to describe these data. We then look at how rainfall may be changing over time and how it varies over space across Western Australia. After that we explore how different modes of climate variability affect annual rainfall. Lastly, we look at the relationships between rainfall and runoff. To achieve this, we use a large number of weather stations across WA to quantify the variability of rainfall in space and time. Throughout the exercise we should remember that rainfall will be influenced by a number of processes that operate on different space and time scales (see Figure 5). We will examine these during this exercise. Figure 5: A guide to the timescales applicable to weather, climate variability and climate change Pacific Climate Futures. Objectives By the end of this activity, you should: Be able to source rainfall data, understand the nature of that data and describe it using simple statistics in Excel. Understand how and why rainfall may be changing over time and use statistics and regression to test hypothesis. Know how different modes of climate variability such as IOD and ENSO affect annual rainfall. Determine the relationships between rainfall and runoff to evaluate the nature of the relationship between rainfall and discharge. Statistical Properties of Rainfall Data Individually (make sure you have at least one person per station but you can have more than one if needed). Start by downloading the daily rainfall data for your site from the Bureau of Meteorology web site. Use the site ID to get the data as below. Download and extract the zipped file to get a CSV file that can be opened in Excel. First, let’s plot the time series of DAILY rainfall. Clean up the plot as required and submit on your answer sheet (1 mark). Describe the main features of this data set. What is the most appropriate type of graph for rainfall data? (3 marks) Calculate the annual SUM of rainfall. We want to ensure that there are only whole years to calculate the sums or else they will be in error. Delete the rows of data for the last partial year (2019) and any partial years at the start. Select the required data across multiple columns (year C to rainfall amount F). Then insert PIVOT table (Create a new tab). Select Year and Rainfall amount as the FIELDS. Drag the Year FIELD into the ROWS box. Left click on the “Sum of Year” in the VALUES box and remove it. Plot the annual sums as a timeseries. Clean up the plot as required and submit on your answer sheet (1 mark). What are the main features of this annual data set? What variability can you see? (2 marks) Use the Data Analysis add-in to calculate descriptive statistics (mean annual rainfall, max annual rainfall, min annual rainfall, Standard deviation of annual rainfall, Skewness) for the whole data (you can install by going to Tools-&gt;Add-ins-&gt;Analysis ToolPack). Copy the results here and complete Table 4 for your site (and others when they are done). Describe the values you got and what they mean. How “useful” are these statistics for your understanding of the system? What if any assumptions are there about these statistics? (4 marks) Next, let’s look at the distribution of the rainfall data. Do this by plotting a histogram of the rainfall data (you will need to decide on a reasonable bin size) and plotting the cumulative probability distribution (you can ask Excel to generate this automatically when it makes the histogram, or generate it manually – each data point represents a probability of 1/#data points). What do these plots tell you about the rainfall data? Are the data normally distributed? (2 marks) Plot the seasonal (monthly average) rainfall. Use a PIVOT table again. Insert PIVOT table (select OK to create a new tab). Select Month and Rainfall amount as the FIELDS; drag the Month FIELD into the ROWS box. Left click on the “Sum of Month” in the VALUES box and remove it. Plot the annual sums as a timeseries. Clean up the plot as required and submit on your answer sheet (2 marks). How would you describe the seasonal pattern of rainfall (hint look at the climate type)? What factors may influence it (hint, think about earth orbit)?

Copy and paste the annual totals from the PIVOT table (include the year and amount columns) into another sheet. Select the last 5 years of data and in DATA ANALYSIS start a REGRESSION. Input the data range. Select “Line Fit Plots”. What did you find and what were you expecting? Is this long enough for a reliable trend? Is the relationship really linear – discuss? (3 marks) Calculate the trend in rainfall for all years available at the site. Copy and paste the annual totals from the PIVOT table (include the year and amount columns) into another sheet. Select the all years of data and INSERT a SCATTER plot. Add a trend line and “display the equation” on the chart. Add the Pearson correlation coefficient (r2) value as well.

How do we frame the hypothesis? What statistical test can we use to test the significance of the hypothesis? Describe the results and conclusions of this analysis. Calculate the appropriate t-value and p-value and enter them also into Table 5. (5 marks) Break into small groups of about 5 and discuss the results of Table 5. Choose a rapporteur to report back at the end of the discussion. Highlight the station where there is a statistically significant slope. Are there statistically significant changes in rainfall? Are they consistent across WA? What may be causing the changes? (5 marks) Spatial patterns in rainfall Take the information in Table 4 and record your values onto the locations of each site on the large class map (whiteboard). Use the maps below to locate your site. When everyone is finished break back into your groups and discuss the results. Choose a new rapporteur to report back at the end of the discussion. Think about the spatial patterns not the temporal ones (i.e climate modes). What spatial patterns might you expect and what do you notice? What may be causing these spatial patterns? (6 marks) "],
