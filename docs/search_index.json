"],["E1A.html", "Exercise 1 – Spatial rainfall variability Introduction Objective Methods Activity Conclusions", " Exercise 1 – Spatial rainfall variability Introduction A fundamental of hydrology is working out how much rain turns into streamflow. But rain does not fall evenly over a catchment area and there are many factors that affect the extent to which the measured rainfall amount at one rain-gauge can be extended to the surrounding area: the distance from the rain-gauge to the centre of the representative area, the size of the area, the topography, the nature of the rainfall quantity (storm event, daily, monthly), the characteristics of the local storm patterns (convective versus low intensity events). Most hydrological analysis at the catchment scale requires knowledge of the areal distribution of precipitation in the form of an average depth (mm) of water for the entire catchment over a specified time period, using information from a set of unevenly placed rain-gauges spread around the area. In order to calculate the flow discharge produced by a large storm (convective type) in the catchment in, it is necessary to calculate the average depth of rainfall (ADR) over the catchment. Three approaches are currently used for estimating the total rainfall: an arithmetic average of gauged quantities, the isohyetal method, and the Thiessen polygon method. Objective In this exercise you will compare these three different approaches for calculating the ADR and estimate the amount of runoff generated by a single rainfall event. Methods In this exercise you are required to calculate the average rainfall (ADR) over the entire catchment using: the arithmetic mean (considering only stations within the catchment boundary), the Thiessen polygon weighting system, and the Isohyetal method. Rainfall data for each station in the catchment is provided in Table 1. You are then required to produce an estimate of catchment runoff, which we will assume is equal to the stream discharge out of the catchment (\\(Q\\)). Recall from lecture slides that a rough estimate of runoff may be estimated using the total rainfall over the catchment during a given period of time, and a runoff coefficient. Figure 1: A depth of rain (\\(P\\), mm/day) is falling over a catchment area (\\(A\\), km2) to produce stream discharge (\\(Q\\), m3/day). Arithmetic Average The most basic measure of average rainfall depth is the arthimetic average, whereby you sum the observed rainfall at each rain gauge inside the catchment and divide by the number of gauges. Theisson Polygon Method The average depth of rainfall (ADR) over the entire catchment can be calculated using: \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathrm{ADR\\ (mm)\\ =\\ }\\frac{\\sum{A_i\\ast P_i}}{\\sum A_i} \\tag{1} \\end{equation}\\] Where \\(A_{i}\\) is the polygon area (km2), \\(P_{i}\\) is the rainfall (mm) corresponding to the \\(i\\) polygon, and \\(\\sum{A_{i}}\\) is the catchment area (km2). Isohyetal Method The average depth of rainfall over the entire catchment can be calculated using: \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathrm{ADR\\ (mm)\\ =\\ }\\frac{\\sum{A_i\\ast P_i}}{\\sum A_i} \\tag{2} \\end{equation}\\] where in this method \\(A_{i}\\) is the area between isohyets \\(P_{i}\\) and \\(P_{i+1}\\) (km2), \\(P_{i}\\) is the average rainfall (mm) corresponding to the area \\(A_{i}\\) between the isohyets, and \\(\\sum{A_{i}}\\) is the total catchment area (km2). Activity Download the answer sheet for this exercise by clicking the download button in the tool bar . You are given the measured data for each rainfall gauge in Table 1. Calculate the arithmetic mean and write this in your summary table (Table 3). Next work out the ADR based on the other two methods. Figure 2: Catchment map, station locations, and isohyetal map for a storm event. Isoheytal map corresponds to rainfall total over a 24hr period. Thiessen Polygons: Sketch the polygons To construct the Thiessen polygons, first draw dashed straight lines between the gauges. Next, find the mid-points of each of these lines and draw another solid line, perpendicular to the dashed line. These solid lines drawn perpendicular to the dashed lines will meet to form irregular polygons Figure 3: Gridded map for polygon construction and area estimates.

This focused on catchment scale rainfall and processes. In this exercise we will learn how to access rain and flow data, and examine the nature of rainfall data and use some simple statistics in Excel to describe these data. This will help you prepare for the Assignment 2A where you will examine at how rainfall may be changing over time, how it varies over space across Western Australia, and how it correlates with flow. Objective By the end of this activity, you should: Be able to source rainfall and flow data, understand the nature of that data and describe it using simple statistics in Excel. Download the activity sheet for this exercise by clicking the download button in the tool bar . Getting Rainfall Data Start by downloading the daily rainfall data for a chosen BOM site from the Bureau of Meteorology web site. Choose a site of interest in Western Australia. Use the site ID to get the data as below. Download and extract the zipped file to get a CSV file that can be opened in Excel. Statistical Properties of Rainfall Data Now, let’s plot the time series of DAILY rainfall. Clean up the plot as required and add to your activity sheet. Describe the main features of this data set. Consider: what is the most appropriate type of graph for rainfall data (bar, scatter, line)? Calculate the annual SUM of rainfall. But note, we want to ensure that there are only whole years to calculate the sums or else the incomplete years will be in error (the sum will be artificially low due to missing data). Delete the rows of data for the last partial year (e.g., 2021) and any partial years at the start (the first and last year measured may change depending on the site you selected). To explore each year’s data we will use a PIVOT table. Select the required data across multiple columns (year C to rainfall amount F). Then insert PIVOT table (select “Create a new tab”). Select Year and Rainfall amount as the FIELDS. Drag the Year FIELD into the ROWS box. Left click on the “Sum of Year” in the VALUES box and remove it. Plot the annual sums as a timeseries. You can also select “COUNT” to see how many entries are given for each. Years with more than 10% of days missing, are unreliable to include in our analysis so see if your station has any incomplete years. Clean up the plot with the sum of rainfall as required and add to your activity sheet. What are the main features of this annual data set? What variability can you see? Now we have a “clean” dataset, we want to explore some statistics. Use the Data Analysis add-in to calculate descriptive statistics (mean annual rainfall, max annual rainfall, min annual rainfall, Standard deviation of annual rainfall, Skewness) for the whole data (you can install by going to Tools-&gt;Add-ins-&gt;Analysis ToolPack). Copy the results here and complete Table 4 for your site (and others when they are done). Describe the values you got and what they mean. How “useful” are these statistics for your understanding of the system? What if any assumptions are there about these statistics? Next, let’s look at the distribution of the rainfall data. Do this by plotting a histogram of the rainfall data (you will need to decide on a reasonable bin size) and plotting the cumulative probability distribution (you can ask Excel to generate this automatically when it makes the histogram, or generate it manually – each data point represents a probability of 1/#data points). What do these plots tell you about the rainfall data? Are the data normally distributed? Plot the seasonal (monthly average) rainfall. Use a PIVOT table again. Insert PIVOT table (select OK to create a new tab). Select Month and Rainfall amount as the FIELDS; drag the Month FIELD into the ROWS box. Left click on the “Sum of Month” in the VALUES box and remove it. Plot the annual sums as a timeseries. Clean up the plot as required and submit on your answer sheet. How would you describe the seasonal pattern of rainfall (hint look at the climate type)? What factors may influence it (hint, think about earth orbit)?

Streamflow data is recently reported on the BOM website for some rivers, but the measurement of streamflow is a State Government responsibility. To get streamflow data, go the Department of Water web site. Use this WIR tool to locate a gauging station near your rainfall site. Add the site to your cart and submit a data request - check that the data is being delivered as a “package of pre-computed reports”. You will then be emailed a zip file of the station’s data. Ensure the station has 10-20 years of available data for this exercise. Once you have the data, explore the CSV file received to see the nature of the data provided - i.e., river flow discharge rate. Can you use the techniques introduced above to summarise the data (e.g., create a PIVOT table)? Conclusions Now you know how to source some essential water data, and summarise it in an easy to use fashion. What else could we do to explore the data?

"],["E4.html", "Exercise 4 - Visualising groundwater Groundwater flow rates Physical model of groundwater system Computer model of groundwater system", " Exercise 4 - Visualising groundwater In this exercise you will investigate what controls the direction and rate of groundwater flow, and investigate groundwater storage and flow within a layered groundwater system. Learning Objectives: At the completion of this exercise students will be able to calculate groundwater flow rates describe the range of flow rates within natural groundwater systems and explain the key factors controlling these rates identify patterns of groundwater flow and hydraulic head contours within layered groundwater systems Groundwater flow rates As a first step lets consider the flux law for groundwater flow. Groundwater flow is driven by the distribution of water pressure (hydraulic head, which has units of length) within the groundwater system. The flow of groundwater follows a flux law; \\[\\begin{equation} q=\\frac{Q}{A}=-K \\frac{\\Delta h}{\\Delta l} \\tag{3} \\end{equation}\\] Where \\(q\\) is the specific discharge (or Darcy Flux) with units of L T-1, \\(Q\\) is the volumetric flow rate (L3 T-1), \\(A\\) is the cross-sectional area through which the water flow (L2), and \\(\\frac{\\Delta h}{ \\Delta l}\\) is the hydraulic gradient. This gradient is simply the change in water pressure (\\(h_1-h_2\\)) over a given distance (L/L, unitless). The key system property in this flux law is the hydraulic conductivity (\\(K\\)), which has units of L T-1. In natural groundwater systems the value of hydraulic conductivity can vary over 12 orders of magnitude. Even though this water flux \\(q\\) has units of L T-1, it’s not actually the velocity of the groundwater, because the water wasn’t flowing through the whole area, just the pore space. To correct for this and calculate the average velocity we need to use the area of the pore space (\\(An\\), where \\(n\\) is porosity), instead of the total area. This gives us; \\[\\begin{equation} \\bar{v}=\\ \\frac{Q}{An}=-\\frac{K}{n} \\frac{\\Delta h}{\\Delta l} \\tag{4} \\end{equation}\\] Where \\(\\bar{v}\\) is the average linear velocity of the water flowing through the porous media. Now that we know these simple equations let’s look at some experimental data from simple “Darcy tubes” that allow us to measure the relationships between rates of groundwater flow, hydraulic gradients and the hydraulic conductivity of the porous media that it flows through. This is how the idea of a “hydraulic conductivity” was first defined, empirically, and it was only decades later that the physical basis for hydraulic conductivity and Darcy’s Law was fully elucidated from first principles (see Hubbert 1940 for some light bedtime reading). Figure 5: a) Photo of simple Darcy Tube and b) diagram showing terms in Darcy’s Law Equation Let’s have a go at using this experimental setup to estimate the hydraulic conductivity of different sedimentary materials. To do this all we need to do is measure the flow rate through the tube for our chosen porous media. For each porous material, the slope determines the hydraulic gradient and we just need to measure the volume that flows out of the tube over a set time interval. During this experiment; the diameter of the tubes was 40 mm the inlet at the top of the tube was 25 cm above the outlet at the bottom of the tube, and the lateral distance between the inlet and the outlet was 0.5 m Over a period 24 hours 168 mL was collected from the tube filled with sand, 3.6 mL was collected from the tube filled with silty sand, and 814 mL of water was collected from the tube filled with gravel. Based on this information you can rearrange Eq (10) to calculate the hydraulic conductivity of each porous media. Are you results consistent with the range of values for similar porous media in the literature? Could you measure the hydraulic conductivity of a clay sample using this experimental setup? What could you do to improve this experiment? Given these hydraulic conductivities, what would the range of linear velocity we could expect in a groundwater system like the Gnangara Mound? Use the following watertable map (taken from Davidson and Yu 2008, HG20) to estimate a hydraulic conductivity, and then calculate linear velocity using Eq (11). You will need to assume a porosity - look these up, or just use 0.25 (which is a good indicative value for back-of-the-envelope calculations in aquifer materials - why not in clays?). Note that it’s probably ok to assume a porosity value because the range of porosity is within one order of magnitude, whereas hydraulic conductivity will vary by multiple orders of magnitude, even within the same type of material, so this will be the larger source of uncertainty in your calculation. How does your estimate of groundwater velocity compare to the streamflow rates you have been working with in previous Exercises? What is the implication for transport and storage of pollutants in the environment? Figure 6: Section of a map of the watertable across Perth Physical model of groundwater system In this part of the exercise we will look at a model of a layered groundwater system. Each layer has a different hydraulic conductivity, \\(K\\), forming two aquifers and an aquitard. Within each layer there will also be variation in hydraulic conductivity. This spatial variation is called “heterogeneity”, and it is an important feature of real groundwater systems. Start by annotating the photo of this model (Figure 6) to show the following; Aquifers and aquitards Recharge and discharge zones Water levels in each of the wells The water table Hydraulic head boundaries Figure 7: Physical model of a layered groundwater system. Now watch this video to see how water moves through the model when dye is injected to see the direction of groundwater flow. Does the flow direction vary spatially? Does the flow direction change over time? Draw arrows on the following screen-shot to show the direction of groundwater flow within the model domain. We have learnt that the measure of potential for groundwater flow is “hydraulic head” and we also know that groundwater flows from high hydraulic head to low hydraulic head. In fact, groundwater flow will be perpendicular to the equipotentials (lines of equal hydraulic head). Based on your inferred flow paths, try now to add in the hydraulic head contours (or equipotentials). It might help for you to think about topographic contours on a landscape map - in this case you have elevation contours, and if you placed a ball at the top of a hill it would roll (or flow) from the higher elevation to the lower elevation. As a general rule, we also know that flow through high conductivity layers will be primarily horizontal, and flow through low conductivity layers will be primarily vertical. Figure 8: Physical model of a layered groundwater system. What can you learn from this physical model about groundwater systems? By using the physical model we have been able to see directly in the subsurface, but in the real world, the only information we have would be the wells. If you only had the hydraulic head measurements in the wells what would you know about the groundwater system? What else would you need to know about this system to calculate groundwater flow velocities (and therefore contaminant transport)? How important is it that we understand the geology as well as having measurements of hydraulic heads? What else might you measure in a real groundwater system to get a fuller picture of what is happening? Computer model of groundwater system We can also run a “digital twin” of the physical model that we have built in the lab. For this activity we will now use the ParFlow Sandtank model. This is a computer model simulating groundwater flow, and allows users to change aquifer configurations and explore the essential features of groundwater and contaminant flow. Once you have watched the introductory video lets take a look at running the model. Navigate to this model website. You can learn how to customise the sandtank and run a simulation here. Have a go at manipulating the soil conditions and the hydraulic head sliders, and run simulations pumping or injecting groundwater. Can you reproduce our lab-based physical model?

What are the potential risks of MAR? Where is managed aquifer recharge happening What do you think about MAR?", " Exercise 6 - Managed aquifer recharge Objectives In this exercise students will consolidate their understanding of managed aquifer recharge, and the role it plays in securing water resources in a changing climate. At the end of this exercise students will be able to: Describe the processes involved in managed aquifer recharge Identify the key benefits and limitations of managed aquifer recharge What is managed aquifer recharge The term managed aquifer recharge refers to the any process by which people intentionally add water to aquifers so that it can be stored in the subsurface. Managed aquifer recharge provides a mechanism to short-circuit the water cycle, so that we don’t need to wait thousands of years for water to re-enter the groundwater system. We aren’t doing anything that wouldn’t happen naturally, we are just making it happen faster (or preferentially) so that we can offset some of the impacts of groundwater withdrawals and climate change. The following diagrams summarizes the key processes that can be associated with managed aquifer recharge - make sure you understand all these processes before proceeding. Figure 9: Processes related to managed aquifer recharge (after Dillon et al. (2019)). How do we get the water into the aquifer? The addition of water to the subsurface can be facilitated by infiltration from the surface (through water spreading, infiltration basins or galleries), or by injecting the water into specially designed injection wells. Let’s think about the pros and cons of each of these approaches. Consider the resources required, associated costs, and potential limitations of each of these two options to complete Table 5 below. Table 5: Pros and cons of surface infiltration vs injection wells for managed aquifer recharge. Pros Cons Infiltration basins Injection wells What are the benefits of managed aquifer recharge? Managed aquifer recharge provides another tool for water resource managers to secure water resources for people and the environment. Subsurface water storage has minimal impact on existing landholders (as compared to dams) and can provide an important mechanism to minimize evaporative losses, and outflows of freshwater to the ocean. By implementing a managed aquifer recharge scheme using water that would otherwise be going out to sea, water resource managers are able to provide an additional water source that is not dependant on rainfall. Sometimes water that has been intentionally added to the aquifer will be used within years or decades by people for potable water or irrigation, or by flora and fauna that depend on groundwater. But even just adding this extra water to the groundwater system can provide protection against risks like 1) seawater intrusion, 2) surface water depletion, or 3) acidification (oxidation of acid sulphate soils), which can be exacerbated by changing climate and groundwater withdrawals. Choose one of these risks and draw a diagram to show how managed aquifer recharge might be used to reduce the risk. What are the potential risks of MAR? The major risk of managed aquifer recharge is about water quality – but maybe not in the way you would think. Sometimes people think of drinking poo-water, and think “icky, no way”. But actually, with the groundwater replenishment scheme here in Perth, the risk is that we are adding very clean oxic water to groundwater that anoxic and contains dissolved solids. The mixing of oxic and anoxic waters results in chemical reactions, and lots of scientific research has been undertaken to determine the likely products of these reactions and that they will not negatively impact our groundwater resources. The injection of groundwater is also not close to the location of drinking water abstraction, so that the water that is added to the groundwater system will remain in the aquifer for a very long time. Time spent in the subsurface can be particularly useful for reducing viral loads or bacteria (but this usually only requires weeks or months, not thousands of years!). In Australia managed aquifer recharge schemes are covered by a national guideline that describes how the potential risks should be determined and managed. There are also policies in Western Australia that address potential impacts to the environment, other water users and human health. Read the section on Governance of MAR in Dillon et al. (2019) (page 20) to learn about how MAR is managed in other countries. Where is managed aquifer recharge happening Managed aquifer recharge is taking place all over the world, ranging from small local-scale schemes to large regional-scale schemes that cost millions of dollars to implement. Enhanced aquifer recharge has actually been happening for decades (leaky water pipes are one example), but the term managed aquifer recharge has been used more recently to describe the intentional additions of water to groundwater systems that are becoming increasingly common as a strategy for water resource management. The following chart from Dillon et al. (2019) shows the development of managed aquifer recharge since 1965 in a range of countries. Which countries were early adopters? Which countries are the current leaders? What proportion of global groundwater use these countries account for (Refer to Table 2 of Dillon et al. (2019))? What do you think about MAR? Hopefully this exercise, and the learning materials in the module on Managed Aquifer Recharge, have helped you learn more about this process, and the relative risks and benefits. What did you know about MAR before this unit? What have you learned that you didn’t know before? Has this module changed your thinking on MAR?

Become familiar with basic spreadsheet commands in Excel by conducting an environmental flow analysis and building a simple impact model. What are environmental flows? Lakes, rivers and estuaries are adapted to receive water based on the natural hydrological condition, but often water is required upstream for other purposes. An environmental flow is water that is provided to the environment to maintain its health and natural diversity In simple terms: Provision of water to satisfy environmental requirements for ‘healthy’ (natural) function. Environmental flows are a form of river/wetland restoration. They are sometimes referred to as “e-flows”. In the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB), a water market was established that allows for irrigation entitlements to be “traded”; e-water must be bought from the “water holder” (in this case that is the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder, CEWH). Classifying e-flow benefits case study : MDB After viewing the 6 videos on LMS related to the Murray-Darling Basin water management issues, you can reflect on the nature of the environmental, economic and social interactions that have characterised the basin. Could you describe the historical events that led to the issues as described, management responses, and the perceived policy failures? The overall management plan for the MDB uses a thing called Sustainable Diversion Limits (SDL’s) where managers identify what is able to be taken from the river, and in converse, what the river needs to function normally. In any river system, water and flows are needed in rivers to maintain: Physical integrity of the river channel and floodplains (e.g., movement of sediment and maintenance of habitat) Species and biological communities Ecological processes (eg. nutrient, carbon, energy flow) Ecosystem services: Flood attenuation Water purification Fish production When we talk about river flows, from an eco-hydrology point of view, we can categorise them as having specific flow “components”. Extreme low flows - reduced connectivity and limited species migration Low flows / base flows - maintain adequate habitat; drinking water for terrestrial animals; and soil moisture for plants High flow pulses - Support feeding and spawning activities of fish Small floods (2 – 10yr ARI) - enable migration to flood plains, wetlands, and other habitats that act as breeding grounds and provide resources to many species. Drive reproduction processes of riparian plants Large floods (&gt;10yr ARI) – Can change the path of the river, form new habitat, and move sediment and plant matter, connect remote environments When allocating water we try to maintain a “realistic” flow hydrograph based on historical (reference) data. But how do we measure the success or failure? Buying e-water costs a lot of money and is a politically charged issue. So we need to know we are getting it right! Ideally we use a “flow-response” model - a measure of what ecological benefit we will get from a certain flow regime. But this is easier said than done, and measuring benefits is an important area of research. So we need to use indicators – “measures of response”. This can include things like: Vegetation Water Quality (WQ) Biodiversity – e.g., fish / macroinvertebrate trophic index We then monitor/assess indicators and adjust environmental flow management regime … in an ideal world. The Murray-Darling Basin Authority (MDBA) has a program called “FLOW MER” - Measuring Evaluation Research to do just this. = Figure 10: Focus study sites where environmental water delivery is assessed in the MDB.

Conclusions In this exercise, we have explored the complexities of allocating water to the environment in a contested situation (i.e., where there are competing “customers” for the water resource). In particular, we can sumamrise environmental flows: appreciate that there is a potential conflict between e-flow vs irrigation allocation e-flow allocation is a river restoration and maintenance tool the array of benefits from e-water need to quantified and maybe site specific there is a need for identifying “Sustainable Diversion Limits” based on assessment of historical flow requirements.

To do this, you will collect soil from different locations of your choosing to analyse. You will then calculate soil moisture content, porosity and field capacity. Importantly, you will finish by thinking about the meaning of your results. Let’s start by remembering some key terms: Porosity: The porosity is the ratio of the volume of the voids to the total volume of the sample. So if you have a sample of 100 cm3 and 30 cm3 is void space (non-solid), then you have a porosity of 0.3 or 30%. Total Moisture Content: is measured by calculating mass loss during oven drying of wet samples at 103-105˚C for 1-2hrs. You can also measure the air-dried moisture content (measured as loss of mass during air-drying at a temperature of around 40˚C. Saturated Water Content: Where all pore space in the soil is occupied by water and no further absorption of rainfall is possible. This will be equal to the total porosity. Field capacity: The water content remaining after water has drained out of the soil under gravity. Technically, this is the moisture content remaining in soil subjected to -0.033MPa (0.3Bar) pressure (i.e. slight vacuum) because capillary action, osmotic pressure and gravity are balanced at this point. In the landscape, the excess water has moved downwared through the soil to become groundwater recharge. Wilting Point: Plant roots can’t extract any more water (i.e. apply a suction stronger than -1.5 MPa) from this soil and begin to die. Permanent wilting point is the moisture content remaining in soil subjected to -1.50MPa (15 Bar) pressure (i.e. moderate vacuum). Available Water Content: This is the amount moisture available for plants to extract, and is caluclated from Field Capacity – Permanent Wilting Point. This water does not drain through to the watertable under gravity, and also is not held too tightly by the soil, so that plants are able access it for uptake through their roots. Sample Collection First, start by collecting your soil samples. Find three locations nearby to you where you can easily access surface soil to a depth of 10cm. Using a trowel, clear the ground surface and use a small “core” (e.g. measuring cup or inverted can) to collect your samples. At each site you should collect three replicate samples. You will probably want to wrap these in foil to keep them from falling apart and then place them in a zip-lock bag (sealed tight to stop the sample drying out) with the sample ID recorded in permanent marker ready for transport back to “the lab” (i.e. your kitchen). While you are in the field make sure you record the coordinates (or location) where you collected the samples. You should also make a brief description of the soil - what colour is it (in real scientific studies we use colour charts to make sure colour descriptions are robust and repeatable). Would you describe your soil sample as sand? Or is it silty, making it feel with finer grains because of the finer grains. Sometimes it’s difficult to tell just by touch whether a sample contains silt or clay because these are both fine-grained. To test for clay you can roll a sample in your palm, if it holds a cylindrical sausage shape then it contains clay. Does your sample seem to have a lot of dark brown organic matter, or not much? For each sample use a balance to record the sample weight, making sure you correctly blank the balance to account for the sample container weight. Record the dimensions and volume of your samples. Then place them onto a tray that is suitable for going into the oven. Then place the tray into the oven for drying at ~105˚C. Leave in the oven until the sample is totally dry and then re-weigh (check after for 1-2 hours). Now you can use your measured data to compute the soil moisture and porosity of each sample following the instructions below. Repeat for the three replicates of each soil and enter your sample details and your results into the online Google sheet. Make sure to enter your data on the correct sheet for this teaching period. Figure 12: A soil sample (core) collected using a kitchen measuring cup. Computing Soil Moisture and Soil Porosity Soil moisture (water content) and porosity (proportion of void space) are key parameters that describe the capacity of soils to store water. Let’s calculate these parameters for each the the soil samples you collected. Soil moisture: For each of your soils samples you should have measured the soil weight before and after drying in the oven. The mass-loss during oven drying represents the weight of water contained in that soil volume. (Note that clayey soils can retain considerable amounts of water when they are air-dry). Based on this water mass we can work out the gravimetric (by weight) and/or volumetric (by volume) water content of each soil sample. The volumetric water content (VWC, \\(\\theta\\), theta, unitless because it is a ratio), is calculated from the mass of wet and oven dried samples and taking into account the total sample volume using Equation (5). You can express this value as a % by multiplying your result from (5) by 100. Enter your results into the online table (via Google Sheets) \\[\\begin{equation} \\theta=\\frac{V_w}{V_T}=\\frac{\\left(M_{\\text{sample}}-M_{\\text{dry}}\\right)}{V_T\\ \\rho_w} \\tag{5} \\end{equation}\\] Soil Porosity: Let’s now calculate the bulk density of the soil, and therefore the porosity of the soil. Bulk density \\(\\rho_b\\) is the mass of dry soil per unit volume. You have already measured the dry volume of your soil, so to determine the bulk density you just need to work out the volume of your soil sample (if it was a column of core then volume = \\(\\pi r^2 h\\) where \\(r\\) is radius and \\(h\\) is height of soil in the sample). From the bulk density and particle density \\(\\rho_p\\) (2.65 g cm-3) you can then calculate the porosity \\(\\phi=\\ \\left(1-\\frac{\\rho_b}{\\rho_p}\\right)\\). This value will also be a ratio, and you can multiply it by 100 to calculate the porosity as a %. Now that you know the porosity, you can estimate the water storage potential, \\(S_{\\text{max}}\\) of your sample by multiplying the soil volume by the porosity as shown in Equation (6). Add your results of these analyses to the online Google Sheet. \\[\\begin{equation} S_{max}=\\ \\phi{\\ V}_{soil} \\tag{6} \\end{equation}\\] ##Computing the runoff coefficient {#L1_4 .unnumbered} What did we learn? Spatial heterogeneity is a substantial issue in subsurface hydrology. What is the variation between sample replicates? How does this compare to the mean of the measured values (i.e. is the variation large relative to the mean?). How much do the soil parameter estimates vary across the whole data set? How did the volumetric water content in your soil compare to your estimate of the total porosity? Was the soil close to saturated, or very dry? Does this make sense in terms of where and when you collected it (time since rainfall, proximity to surface water or drainage). Based on your measured Smax, what would be the water storing capacity in the upper 2 m of soil over an area of 1 km2 ? Does this seem like a lot of water, or not much? How does your estimate of field capacity compare to your estimate of the total porosity? Does this seem reasonable? What does this mean for plant water availability? What are the sources of error in your parameter estimates? What could you improve if you had to do this again? What haven’t we measured that would also be useful to know about soils if we want to understand runoff and streamflow generation mechanisms? "],["L2.html", "Lab 2 - Streamflow analysis Measuring Stream Velocity &amp; Discharge Making Sense of Streamflow Data", " Lab 2 - Streamflow analysis In this module we understand how to generate streamflow data, and then how to use it charcaterise variability in stream discharge rates. Measuring Stream Velocity &amp; Discharge The process of measuring stream flow (volume rate of flow), or discharge, is called stream gauging. There are numerous methods of stream gauging, including direct methods, such as volumetric gauging, and dilution methods, as well as indirect methods involving stage-discharge relations, or rating curves. Since the velocity of a stream varies with depth and width across a stream, it is important to understand what it is you want to measure when choosing a stream gauging method. If you are interested in stream surface velocity, a simple float method would work well. This method involves throwing some buoyant, highly visible object into the stream and measuring the time it takes to float a known distance. If you are interested in obtaining a more accurate stream discharge measurement, the velocity-area method is your method of choice. Stream flow (discharge) can be measured based on two fundamental methods, which are each expanded upon below (refer to lecture 3 for details). The first requires a direct measurement of velocity, whereas the second is an approximation based on stream-bed slope and geometry. Flow Rate: Velocity-Area Method Flow estimates in natural streams and artificial channels under steady (no change in depth with time) and uniform (no change in depth with space) conditions can be computed by the product of mean flow velocity (integrated in depth and across the channel) and the cross-sectional area of flow. The equation \\(Q = V * A\\), were \\(V\\) (m/s) is the mean velocity and \\(A\\) (m2) is the flow (or water) cross-sectional area is used for this purpose. Large streams and rivers, a section control is needed to generate the “rating curve” thus establishing a relationship between water stage height (\\(H\\)) and flow discharge (\\(Q\\)). In this case, both flow velocity measurements and cross-sectional areas are needed. Discharge using the Velocity-Area method is measured by integrating the area and velocity of each point across the stream. The channel or stream is divided into sections based on where the velocity and stage height measurements were taken in the cross-section of the stream/channel. The flow velocity is measured using a current meter (i.e. propeller, electromagnetic, ultrasonic, and Doppler). The discharge is computed using: \\[\\begin{equation} Q = \\sum^{n}_{i=0} (V_{i} * \\text{Area}_{i}) \\tag{7} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(n\\) is the number of vertical for measuring velocities, \\(V_{i}\\) is the mean velocity value for vertical \\(i\\) (m/s) and \\(\\text{Area}_i\\) is the cross-sectional area around vertical \\(i\\) (m2). The cross-sectional area is best estimated by treating the sections as rectangles, trapezia or triangles. Figure 13: Current-meter discharge measurements are made by determining the discharge in each subsection of a channel cross section and summing the subsection discharges to obtain a total discharge. To measure stream velocity we can utilise a “swoffer” – a pole with a propeller on the end with an electronic logger recording the rotations. A current meter is so designed that its rotation speed varies linearly with the stream velocity at the location of the instrument. A more modern alternative is an “ADV” (Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter). This relies on a method where it looks at the scatter of sound waves rebounding of particles/bubbles in the water, and based on the “Doppler effect” (recall the sound of a train changing pitch as it moves past you), it can compute the water velocity. Figure 14: An ADV - used to measure stream velocity. Activity: Watch the videos below showing the principles of how to measure the velocity of water. Then calculate the streamflow at the two sites in Table. The “section” column tells you nominally where you are across the x-section, the “width” column is the actual width of flow you should use in your calculations. Each velocity and depth measurement was made at the distance across the stream reported in the “distance” column. Does the wider stream section have more streamflow? Is this what you would have expected? Site 1 is upstream of Site 2, did the flow increase or decrease downstream? What might have caused this change in flow?

In practice, when you are in the field the bottom slope (\\(S\\)) will be measured by using a differential GPS (DGPS). You also need to measure the ‘wetted perimeter’ (\\(P\\)) of the channel and the cross sectional area (\\(A\\)). The roughness coefficient (\\(n\\)) should be assumed from the literature, based on your observations or the stream and a table like the one below, or here, or here, or here. Activity: For this activity we will use some of the same measured data that we used for the velocity-area method. Those measurements were taken on Carey Brook, a tributary to the Donnelly River in south-west Western Australia (near Pemberton). You have already calculated the total area (sum the individual areas calculated in the velocity-area method). Draw a scale diagram of your chosen cross-section to estimate the wetted perimeter. Use the slope over the 5.2 km of Carey Bk between the main highway (25 m AHD) and where it flows into the Donnelly River (7 m AHD). Now you just need a roughness parameter, Manning’s \\(n\\), and you can solve Equation (8). How does this streamflow estimate compare to the answer you got using the velocity-area method above? How sensitive is your answer to the value of Manning’s \\(n\\)? Making Sense of Streamflow Data The first step in any hydrologic data analysis project is to gather the data and relevant background information on your catchment of interest. In Western Australia the WIR website contains all of the data and information you need, and we will use this in our future assignments. All states/countries have something similar; the USA has one of the best examples through the USGS NWIS website. If you click the site information button, enter your gage name or number, and browse the available datasets for your river. For this analysis, you will need daily discharge data, peak streamflow, and the annual water data report. Other datasets may also be helpful for understanding the hydrologic behavior of your river. Hydrologic analyses are almost always conducted for “water years” not calendar years. In the Northern Hemisphere. A water year begins on October 1 and ends September 30 . In the Southern Hemisphere it Starts May 1 and ends April 30, though this can be region specific. Daily Unit Discharge Hydrograph Figure 15: The Avon River, Western Australia Unit discharge is the total discharge of the river divided by the watershed area. Thus, it has units of m3/s/km2. Unit discharge is very useful for comparing the hydrologic behaviour of catchments of different size (since discharge scales with area). Depending on your data source you will need to download data and do appropriate conversions in a spreadsheet. A properly formatted unit discharge hydrograph has a descriptive title, labelled axes, and a logarithmic y-axis. If you need help with formatting the graph in Excel, please don’t hesitate to ask for help! Activity: Go to the WIR web link, and download the continuous flow data for the Swan River “Walyunga” gauge (616011). In Excel, explore the data. Create a hydrograph comparing discharge between a wet year and a dry year (i.e. plot two years on a common x-axis. Use “hydrologic years” rather than calendar years. Label accordingly. Repeat the exercise but this time creating a unit hydrograph - for this you will need to divide by the catchment area; refer to the above information and check units are consistent. This gauge is draining the Avon catchment Figure 16: Navigate to the ‘Walyunga’ guage (616011) Flow Duration Curves What is it? The flow duration curve is a plot that shows the percentage of time that flow in a stream is likely to equal or exceed some specified value of interest. For example, it can be used to show the percentage of time river flow can be expected to exceed a design flow of some specified value (e.g., 20 m3/s), or to show the discharge of the stream that occurs or is exceeded some percent of the time (e.g., 80% of the time). How is it calculated? The basic time unit used in preparing a flow-duration curve will greatly affect its appearance. For most studies, mean daily discharges are used. These will give a steep curve. When the mean flow over a long period is used (such as mean monthly flow), the resulting curve will be flatter due to averaging of short-term peaks with intervening smaller flows during a month. Extreme values are averaged out more and more, as the time period gets larger (e.g., for a flow duration curve based on annual flows at a long-record station). Step 1: Sort (rank) average daily discharges for period of record from the largest value to the smallest value, involving a total of \\(n\\) values. Step 2: Assign each discharge value a rank (\\(M\\)), starting with 1 for the largest daily discharge value. Step 3: Calculate exceedence probability (\\(P\\)) as follows: \\[\\begin{equation} P = 100 * [\\frac{M}{n+1}] \\tag{9} \\end{equation}\\] Where, \\(P\\) = the probability that a given flow will be equaled or exceeded (% of time), \\(M\\) = the ranked position on the listing (dimensionless), and \\(n\\) = the number of events for period of record (dimensionless). Activity: Follow the above steps using the 616011 gauge data to create your own flow duration curve. What does this particular information tell you about your stream? A flow duration curve characterizes the ability of the basin to provide flows of various magnitudes. Information concerning the relative amount of time that flows past a site are likely to equal or exceed a specified value of interest is extremely useful for the design of structures on a stream. For example, a structure can be designed to perform well within some range of flows, such as flows that occur between 20 and 80% of the time (or some other selected interval). The shape of a flow-duration curve in its upper and lower regions is particularly significant in evaluating the stream and basin characteristics. The shape of the curve in the high-flow region indicates the type of flood regime the basin is likely to have, whereas, the shape of the low-flow region characterizes the ability of the basin to sustain low flows during dry seasons. A very steep curve (high flows for short periods) would be expected for rain-caused floods on small watersheds. Snowmelt floods, which last for several days, or regulation of floods with reservoir storage, will generally result in a much flatter curve near the upper limit. In the low-flow region, an intermittent stream would exhibit periods of no flow, whereas, a very flat curve indicates that moderate flows are sustained throughout the year due to natural or artificial streamflow regulation, or due to a large groundwater capacity which sustains the base flow to the stream. An example, properly formatted flow duration curve is shown below (Figure 17). Figure 17: Aproperly formatted flow duration curve Flood Frequency Analysis What is it? Flood frequency analyses are used to predict design floods for sites along a river. The technique involves using observed annual peak flow discharge data to calculate statistical information such as mean values, standard deviations, skewness, and recurrence intervals. These statistical data are then used to construct frequency distributions, which are graphs and tables that tell the likelihood of various discharges as a function of recurrence interval or exceedence probability. Flood frequency distributions can take on many forms according to the equations used to carry out the statistical analyses. Four of the common forms are: Normal Distribution; Log-Normal Distribution; Gumbel Distribution; and Log-Pearson Type III Distribution. Each distribution can be used to predict design floods; however, there are advantages and disadvantages of each technique. While the log Pearson Type III distribution is the recommended technique, its application is a bit more complex than we are going to undertake for this class. Instead, we will use the older Weibull plotting position method. Flood frequency information can be determined from knowledge of the peak discharge (highest discharge) in any given year provided enough years of information has been collected. This allows one to relate the expected recurrence interval for a given discharge, and determine the probability that a flood of a given discharge will occur in any given year. The recurrence interval for a given discharge can be calculated by first ranking the discharges. Activity: In the Table below for “Big River”, fill in the Rank column. To do this, enter a 1 for the maximum discharge that has occurred during the 20 years of available data. The second highest discharge will be given a rank of 2, etc. with the lowest discharge given a value of 20. Table 7: Complete the table for ‘Big River’ Date Maximum Discharge (m3/s), \\(Q\\) Rank, \\(m\\) Recurrence Interval, \\(R\\) 28-Feb-86 1410 4-Mar-87 2890 22-Mar-88 1850 3-Mar-89 800 1-Feb-90 1000 12-Apr-91 692 4-Apr-92 1350 2-May-93 1200 16-Mar-94 850 6-Jul-95 2400 21-Feb-96 890 30-Jan-97 1480 16-Mar-98 1500 21-Feb-99 1300 12-May-00 1700 8-Apr-01 2200 1-Mar-02 1830 8-Feb-03 1120 12-Mar-04 750 6-Mar-05 1250 After you have filled in the Rank column, you can now calculate the recurrence interval for each peak discharge. The recurrence interval, \\(R\\), is given by the Weibull Equation: \\[\\begin{equation} R = \\frac{n+1}{m} \\tag{10} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(n\\) is the number of years over which the data was collected (20 years in this case), and \\(m\\) is the rank of each peak discharge. Use this equation to calculate the recurrence interval for each peak discharge. Next, use the graph below (or Excel) to plot a graph of discharge (on the y-axis) versus recurrence interval (on the x-axis). Note that the x-axis must be a logarithmic scale. If drawig by hand you should try to estimate as best you can where the data point will fall between the lines on the graph. Once you have plotted the points use a ruler to draw the best fit straight line through the data points (lay a ruler on the graph and try to draw a line that most closely approximates all of the data points). Do not draw lines that connect individual data points. If you are plotting in Excel you will fit a linear trendline. By extrapolating your line on the graph, determine the peak discharge expected in a flood with a recurrence interval of 50 years and 100 years. These are the discharges expected in a 50 year flood and a 100 year flood. The annual exceedence probability, \\(P_{e}\\), is the probability that a given discharge will occur in a given year. It is calculated as the inverse of the recurrence interval, \\(R\\): \\[\\begin{equation} P_{e} = \\frac{1}{R} \\tag{11} \\end{equation}\\] Thus, the probability that a flood with a 10 year recurrence interval will occur in any year is 1/10 = 0.1 or 10%. What are the probabilities that a 50 year flood and a 100 year flood will occur in any given year? Extra activity: Repeat the above flood frequency analysis using the 616011 Walyunga data set that you downloaded in Excel (Hint, use a pivot table and the max option to get the annual maximum discharge). "],["E4-1.html", "Lab 3 - Groundwater and surface water interaction", " Lab 3 - Groundwater and surface water interaction Learning Objectives In this experiment, you will use data from a physical model of a catchment during a simulated rainfall event to calculate the relative contributions of pre-event and event water to that streamflow. The real-world setting for the experiment is a gaining stream (Figure 18). At the conclusion of this exercise students will have demonstrated an ability to: analyse measured experimental data to characterize the key properties of a rainfall event. quantify pre-event and event components of water in a storm hydrograph (hydrochemical baseflow separation). discuss the significance of experimental results for managing water resources in the context of surface water - groundwater interaction. Background A question we often want to be able to answer is how much groundwater is contributing to flow in a river, and how much is water that came from recent rainfall. This is relevant for water resources planning so we can work out the discharge rate of an aquifer, or for water quality management. Figure 18: Groundwater discharge to a gaining stream. Groundwater usually has different chemical characteristics to storm runoff during a rainfall event and we can use this chemical signal as a tracer for groundwater contribution. In this experiment you will demonstrate how groundwater (pre-event water) contribution to river flow changes over the course of a storm event, relative to water that fell as rain during the storm event (event water). You will use the tracer dilution technique with salinity (measured as electrical conductivity, EC) as the groundwater tracer. Experimental Method Set up of apparatus The experimental set-up consists of a tray of soil, the ability to add rainfall (via a connection to the tap) and discharge outlets at the bottom of the catchment. During the experiment loggers are set up to measure the rainfall amount as well as streamflow and EC at the catchment outlet over time (Figure 19).There are loggers for rainfall, streamflow and EC that are connected to a computer. Figure 19: Experimental setup showing the catchment tray, rainfall, sprinklers and logger location. Create the aquifer The first step was to create the “aquifer” by loading the bottom of the tray with river sand. The top surface was smoothed so that it was an even thickness across the catchment and then the volume of this layer was estmated. Importantly, the top of aquifer sits below the top line of outlets as shown in Figure 20. A core to sample of the soil was collected so that you can compute the starting soil moisture (refer to Exercise 3A for the methodology to do this). To create the pre-event groundwater, the sand was saturated with saline water (making sure to note the EC of the saline solution) and any excess ponded water removed with a syringe before proceeding. Figure 20: Saturated aquifer correctly set up within catchment model. Create the unsaturated zone This saturated aquifer layer was then overlain with a second layer of dry soil, being careful not to disturb the original layer. This upper layer was shaped into the form of a catchment (concave) so that when the subsurface fills up there was a stream flowing to the catchment outlet (Figure 21). The middle outlet should not be covered with soil, but the soil should be just below this outlet (this is your riverbed). At this step you could see some capillary rise of aquifer water into the vadose zone. Figure 21: Unsaturated zone on to of aquifer. Topography should slope towards the middle and the catchment outlet. Make it rain The rainfall outlets were brought close to the catchment surface to avoid “raining” outside the catchment, and then the tubes at the bottom of the catchment were turned so that they were directed into the PVC drain so that outflow could be measured. And now the rain! The apparatus was left with the rain on for approximately 20 minutes until the catchment had filled up, stream flow had begun and the EC at the catchment outlet has clearly decreased (Figure 22). To finish, the rain was turned off, but with the loggers still running for another 20 minutes, or until streamflow ceased, so we could measure what happens after the rain had stopped. Figure 22: Streamflow at the catchment outlet. Data Analysis QA-QC of data Download the data provided. Before you can start your analysis you might need to clean the data – remove any outliers and identify where your experimental data start and stop. You have very high temporal resolution data, which combines with the sensitivity of your loggers to give you a lot of noise. Consider calculating a running average (over 60 seconds or more) to get smooth temporal trends. Characterizing the rainfall event Once you are happy with your clean data set you can use the logged data to identify the properties of the storm event, including: Time from rainfall onset to when runoff began to be recorded (mins), Time to peak discharge (mins), Total rainfall volume (cm3), Total runoff volume (cm3), Average rainfall intensity (cm/min), The runoff coefficient, \\(c\\), for the ‘storm’ event. Separating pre-event and event water Now let’s calculate the contributions of pre-event (baseflow = groundwater) and event (rainfall and runoff) water. Because the groundwater was saline you can use the tracer dilution method (see the blue box below for details) to calculate the fraction of the hydrograph that is from baseflow. In other words, we want to calculate and plot a hydrograph showing each of the components of the water balance: \\(Q_{\\text{out}}(t) = Q_{\\text{event}} + Q_{\\text{pre-event}}\\) where \\(Q_{\\text{out}}\\) (cm3/s) is the volumetric flow rate measured at the outlet of the catchment, \\(Q_{\\text{event}}\\) (cm3/s) is the volumetric flow rate of event water (representing rainfall and runoff) and \\(Q_{\\text{pre-event}}\\) is the volumetric flow rate of pre-event water (representing groundwater). If there is a difference in the salinity of groundwater and rainfall-runoff then we can estimate the groundwater contribution to the streamflow by looking at changes in salinity at the catchment outlet (measured as electrical conductivity, or EC). To do this we assume that the EC in groundwater is at a pre-event reference level, \\(S_{\\text{pre-event}}\\), and EC in the rain \\(S_{\\text{event}}\\) is effectively 0. The level of dilution in EC in streamflow can then be used to estimate the fraction of pre-event (groundwater baseflow) and event (rainfall-runoff) water contributing to total streamflow. The salt mass balance tells us that the total salt mass coming out of the catchment via the stream must equal the sum of pre-event and event components: \\(S_{\\text{out}} * Q_{\\text{out}} = S_{\\text{event}} * Q_{\\text{event}} + S_{\\text{pre-event}} * Q_{\\text{pre-event}}\\) And because the rainfall and runoff didn’t have any salt added, \\(S_{\\text{event}} = 0\\) So that we can cancel the “event” term and rearrange to solve for the pre-event component of volumetric flow: \\(Q_{\\text{pre-event}} = S_{\\text{out}}*Q_{\\text{out}} / S_{\\text{pre-event}}\\) And once this pre-event component is known, we can calculate the event component of volumetric flow from rearranging the water balance to give: \\(Q_{\\text{event}} = Q_{\\text{out}} - Q_{\\text{pre-event}}\\) Interpretation and conclusions How do the relative amounts of pre-event and event water change over time? Is the change in \\(Q_{\\text{pre-event}}/Q_{\\text{event}}\\) over time what you would expect? How could attributes of the experimental setup have increased or decreased the baseflow contribution? How would the results have changed if we ran the experiment again, starting with a wetted-up unsaturated zone? How realistic is the experiment in terms of capturing the interaction of surface water and groundwater? What are the significance of these results for water resource management?

Part A focuses on rainfall and streamflow data, and you will complete this during week 1 and 2 of the unit. Part B extends our focus to the subsurface, linking surface water and groundwater hydrology. "],["A1A.html", "Part A - Rainfall and streamflow data analysis Objectives Temporal trends in rainfall Spatial patterns in rainfall Interannual variability in rainfall Relationship between rainfall and runoff Submission", " Part A - Rainfall and streamflow data analysis In this assessment we will explore the nature of rainfall and runoff data. Rainfall is influenced by a number of processes that operate on different space and time scales (see Figure 23). We first examine these during this exercise and then we explore how different modes of climate variability affect patterns in annual rainfall. Lastly, we look to see if we can find a relationship between rainfall and streamflow (assumed equal to runoff). To achieve this, we use a large number of weather stations across WA to quantify the variability of rainfall in space and time. In this assignment you will work to explore data from an individual site. You will then share with class members the results from your site so we can build a more complete picture. We will be sharing our data using an online spreadsheet. Please make sure that you upload your data as soon as possible so that others can include it in their analysis. Figure 23: A guide to the timescales applicable to weather, climate variability and climate change Pacific Climate Futures. Objectives By the end of this assignment, you should: Understand how and why rainfall may be changing over time and use statistics and regression to test this hypothesis. Know how different modes of climate variability such as IOD and ENSO can affect annual rainfall. Be able to elucidate the nature of the relationship between rainfall and streamflow. Temporal trends in rainfall Prior to starting this work, make sure you have completed the Exercise 1B activity. For your chosen site, calculate the trend in rainfall for the last 5 years. Either copy and paste the annual totals from the PIVOT table (include the year and amount columns) or calculate the manually. Select the last 5 years of data and in DATA ANALYSIS start a REGRESSION. Input the data range for x (the independant variable) and y (the dependant variable). Select “Line Fit Plots”. What did you find and what were you expecting? Is this long enough for a reliable trend? Is the relationship really linear – discuss? (You can do this same analysis by adding a trend-line to the data, as described in 2. below). Now, calculate the trend in rainfall for all years available at the site. You can calculate that annual total rainfall using a PIVOT table (include the year and amount columns) or by calculating them manually using SUM. Select the all years of data and INSERT a SCATTER plot. Add a linear trend line and “display the equation” on the chart. The slope of the equation of the line tells you the trend. Add the Pearson correlation coefficient (r2) value as well to see how well the line fits the data (1 is a perfect fit, 0 is no fit). Add the information for your site into Table 8 and the online spreadsheet). Table 8: Bureau of Meteorology Automatic Weather Station data and station ID across WA and SWWA. Complete the table for each site.

Using the full temporal dataset (all years), perform a REGRESSION analysis like you did in the first question. These results will inclue a t-statistic (t Stat) and P-value, enter them also into Table 8. The null hypothesis is the the rainfall did NOT change over time. If the P-value is smaller than alpha = 0.05 then we can REJECT the null hypothesis (which means that the rainfall amount has changed significantly over time). You can also reject the null hypothesis if the t-statistic is less than -2.101 or greater than 2.101 (based on a normal distribution). Describe the results and conclusions of this analysis. Inspect the results of everyone’s analysis for Table 8 Google Sheets version. Which station(s) have a statistically significant slope. Are there statistically significant changes in rainfall? Are they consistent across WA? What may be causing the changes? Spatial patterns in rainfall Take the information in Table 4 (Google Sheets version) and record the values onto a map of Western Australia. Now think about the spatial patterns rather than the temporal ones (i.e climate modes). What spatial patterns might you expect and what do you notice? What may be causing these spatial patterns? Interannual variability in rainfall Here we determine how rainfall correlates with known modes of climate variability (i.e. Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Other indicators of temporal variability (look for cyclic patterns). Does rainfall correlate with known modes of climate variability (i.e. IOD and ENSO using the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI). SOI is calculated as follows. \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{SOI} = 10 \\frac{P_{\\text{diff}} - P_{\\text{diffav}}}{SD(P_{\\text{diff}})} \\tag{12} \\end{equation}\\] Where: \\(P_{\\text{diff}}\\) = (average Tahiti MSLP for the month) - (average Darwin MSLP for the month) \\(P_{\\text{diffav}}\\) = long term average of \\(P_{\\text{diff}}\\) for the month in question, and \\(SD(P_{\\text{diff}})\\) = long term standard deciation of \\(P_{\\text{diff}}\\) for the month in question. IOD is calculated by anomalous Sea Surface Temperature gradient between the western equatorial Indian Ocean (50E-70E and 10S-10N) and the south eastern equatorial Indian Ocean (90E-110E and 10S-0N) in units of degrees Kelvin. We will use the extremely useful Climate Explorer for the next section. First you will need to register so you can save data series. Access the rainfall from the previous site that you used in the previous section. Click on “Monthly Station Data” (right hand menu), select “precipitation” from the “GHCN-M (all)” column, search for your station (e.g. type BROOME in the “Select stations” section), and then press “Get stations”. If the selection works you will see relevant stations listed, and then click “get data”. You will then see graphs and options for further integrating the data. Make a name to save the data (the default should be fine). Click “Add to list”. Now get the first climate index for the IOD called the DMI. Go to “Monthly climate indices” and then select DMI. Note any trend and variability in the index. To correlate the index and rainfall select “Correlate with other time series”. And tick your previously saved rainfall timeseries and then press “Correlate” and copy the results into Table 9 and the appropriate tab in the online spreadsheet. Table 9: Rainfall and climate indices (DMI for IOD and SOI for ENSO) correlations. Month DMI Corr DMI p-value SOI Corr SOI p-value Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Highlight any months that have a significant p-value (&lt;0.05). What relationships do you see between rainfall and climate mode and why? Do they correlate in specific seasons? How strong are these correlations really? How are they consistent or different across WA? We can do the same exercise except using gridded data (climate data divided into say 0.5 degree spacing using reanalysis information) to investigate the whole of Australia. Click on “Monthly observations” and go to Precipitation CRU TS 0.5. We then want to correlate each grid cell on the earth with our climate index (SOI and DMI) to see how the correlations very spatially. Click on “Correlate with a time series” and choose either SOI or DMI. Then click correlate at the bottom and wait (the calculations are being done online and the graph returned for viewing). Do the same for both SOI and DMI. For DMI which month had the highest (negative) correlation (copy that plot to your results). What areas of Australia have significant correlations and what time of year? For SOI which month had the highest (positive) correlation (copy that plot to your results). What areas of Australia have significant correlations and what time of year? Does this match with your own rainfall station correlations? Relationship between rainfall and runoff Now lets examine the relationship between annual rainfall and annual streamflow (also called discharge by surface hydrologists). Go to the Department of Water web site and download the streamflow data closest to your rainfall stations to examine this relationship (Refer to the Exercise 1B activity for details on how to source the data - make sure the site has streamflow data by checking the data availability and the request the report for water levels and flow - continuous to get the flow data). Plot a scatter plot of annual streamflow (y-axis) and annual rainfall (x-axis). Add a trendline to the chart. What are the relationships between rainfall and streamflow? Are they linear or non-linear and why? Add the data for your site to the online spreadsheet so we can look at the whole data set - are there consistent relationships across WA? If not, explain the variation. Submission Your submission for this assessment is a summary report outlining the results of the analysis and questions posed in questions 1-8, above. This should include the figures and tables you created, summarising the data from your chosen site and the broader class data-set. Your report should have a title and the information should be grouped into numbered headings and sub-headings, like a scientific journal article. Start with an introduction, then you will have 4 data sections: 1) temporal trends in rainfall, 2) spatial patterns in rainfall, 3) interannual variability in rainfall and 4) relationships between rainfall and runoff. Finally, you should write a conclusion that summarizes the main findings and links back to the objectives you stated in your introduction. Make sure that all the text in your figures is legible. For charts, all axes should be clearly labeled and units given where appropriate. Make sure to include appropriate captions to describe your tables and figures, and cite these in the text (Figure captions go below the figure. Table captions go above the table). You will be assessed according to the rubric provided on LMS. Be sure to submit your report via the Turnitin Link on LMS by the due date and time. Late submissions will attract penalties in line with UWA policy. "],["A2B.html", "Part B - Groundwater and surface water interaction: A case study on the Helena River", " Part B - Groundwater and surface water interaction: A case study on the Helena River Learning Objectives This assessment will require students to understand how hydrologic monitoring of can inform the conceptual models of ecosystems that underpin solutions to management challenges. The data set that you will work on is part of a long-term research investigation being undertaken with the WA Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions (DBCA) and UWA. The goal of this research is to understand the drivers of decline of E. rudis in relation to the changing hydrology regime at the Guildford floodplains along the Helena river. At the completion of this assessment students will have demonstrated their ability to: analyse and interpret measured hydrological data develop a conceptual hydrological model effectively communicate their understanding of a hydrological system through a written report Background The degradation of freshwater systems by increasing salinity is a major challenge facing Western Australia. Salinisation of the Avon river, which enters the Upper Swan river at Walyunga National Park, arose due to poor land-management leading to secondary salinity in the inland wheatbelt catchments. Whilst secondary salinity is not an issue in the Swan Coastal Plain where our study site is, the salt loads from the Avon in addition to rising sea levels and decreasing rainfall trend have been driving changes in the seasonal movement of marine waters, with increasing penetration of the salt wedge further inland from the ocean (Huang et al. 2018). The City of Swan has identified our focus site on the Helena River near Guildford as an area of concern due to the decline of Eucalyptus rudis. E. rudis plays a vital role in the riparian ecosystem. Riparian woodland species are important filters that reduce nutrient transfers from the land into the river, which is a significant issue in the Swan river and its tributaries (excessive nutrients have historically resulted in noxious algal blooms). There is therefore a need to better understand what drives decline and if projected drying conditions for the region will make the pressures worse. Salinisation of river systems can cause shifts in floodplain vegetation which arise because of river water interaction with the floodplain. Depending on the salinity increase and the salt tolerance of the floodplain tree species, this can cause shifts in community structure. Eucalyptus rudis is important species that has a natural range along the Swan river and its tributaries. This species has been reported to be in decline for over 15 years along the Swan river (Clay &amp; Majer 2001), and more recently along one of the tributaries of the Swan river: the Guildford floodplains of the Helena river (Dundas 2011). It is currently unknown the exact role of water availability and salinity in the observed decline, and alternate hypothesis related to tree pathogens (e.g. Phytophthora) are also as drivers of decline are also under investigation. Helena River Study Site Start by watching this video recorded by Matt Hipsey to give you an introduction to the Helena River site. You can see the key features of the site marked on this aerial photo. The natural surface drainage of the site has been altered by artificial surface drainage channels. A series of monitoring wells have previously been installed at the site. The following LIDAR image shows the surface topography, with the locations of groundwater wells also indicated. Figure 24: High-resolution LIDAR image of the surface topography of the Helena River study site in Guildford. The red-circles indicate groundwater observation wells. These groundwater monitoring wells are holes that have been drilled into the ground and lined with PVC pipes that has slots at the bottom to let the water in. All you can see from the land surface is the top of the PVC casing sticking up with a cap and sometimes a lock on it. If you want to use these wells for a scientific purpose you need to know the construction details. Firstly, where is the well (GPS coordinates) and what are the dimensions (depth and diameter) of the well? The well dimensions will determine the equipment you need to sample it. Secondly, across what depth range (and more importantly, elevation) is the screen interval (the area where slots are present)? This is the actual elevation of your groundwatre pressure measurement; it’s important that you know this so that you can compare your measurement with existing data. Once you get to a well, the first thing to do is measure the depth to water - from this measurement you can work out the elevation of the watertable, and also how much water is sitting in the well (standing water). If you want to sample for salinity or hydrochemical properties, then as a rule of thumb you need to remove 3-times this volume of standing water from the well before you take the sample to ensure the sample is representative of the aquifer. Your task During this assessment you will use existing data to delineate the hydrologic pathways (surface and sub-surface) that determine the distribution of water and salt in this floodplain system. You will use this information to develop a hydrological conceptual model of this site. Your assessment report should describe the context of the investigation and summarise your findings and observations as suitable for a reader such as the City of Swan Environmental Management team. After your analysis you should be able to: Identify the distressed and dead trees at the site Identify the surface water flow regime - where and when does surface water pond or flow Articulate the key features of the groundwater system - water level trends, groundwater flow directions, and surface water - groundwater interaction areas Assess the distribution of salinity in groundwater wells (piezometers) and surface water Conceptualise the hydrologic processes influencing salt movement and accumulation across the site Articulate possible links between this conceptualization and declining health of E. Rudis The data you need for the assessment is in the file Helena Data Combined.xlsx Literature review Start by reading this report by UWA researchers to learn more about the history of scientific studies at this site and recent findings: Mapping vegetation change There are now a range of spatial data products that have been generated from aerial imagery and remote sensing methods that we can use to help understand hydrological processes. One of these products is Nearmap, which allows us to access aerial imagery to investigate the changes in vegetation (and surface water distribution) over time. Nearmap can be accessed at: http://maps.au.nearmap.com (login via UWA library Onesearch - see this webpage for details). Once you have successfully logged into Nearmap you can find the study site by searching for Guildford and then identifying the confluence of the Helena and Swan Rivers. Figure 25: In Nearmap you can search for Guildford (green marker) to help you locate the study site at the confluence of the Helena and Swan Rivers (Blue shded area) Zoom in so that you can see the vegetation canopy clearly and then use the time bar at the top to look at changes over time (play button will scroll through all available images, clock icon will split the screen so you can compare two different dates. What seasonal changes can you see in the images? How has the vegetation changed between the oldest and the most recent images (compare similar times of year)? As you scroll through time does there seem to be a period of more rapid decline? Are there any periods of recovery? You can also see the distribution of surface water on the Nearmap imagery - compare what you see with the following mapping of surface water inundation at the site. Figure 26: Example inundation pattern. Which way is the water flowing? Mapping salinity (EC) in QGIS Surface water samples from across the site have previously been collected and analysed for electrical conductivity (EC), which is a measure of salinity. Let’s create a map to visualise the spatial variation in salinity across the study site. The following instructions take you through the steps to do this in QGIS, which can be downloaded here. If you are proficient in ArcGIS you can use that instead to create your map. Let’s start by importing our EC point data. Go to Layer -&gt; Add Layer -&gt; Add Delimited Text Layer. Under File name navigate to a csv file of the EC data Make sure under File Format ‘CSV’ is selected Under Geometry Definition set the X field to the Easting column of you EC data and the Y field to the Northing column Set the Geometry CRS to “EPSG:32750 - WGS84/UTM zone 50S” Click Add Figure 27: Importing your EC data. Make sure your data takes this form in Excel. Save it as a CSV: You’ll now see the point data added to your screen, however, we have no spatial context - let’s add a basemap. Go to the QuickMapServices (QMS) button in the toolbar and browse/search for a basemap that you think would be appropriate (e.g. search “satellite” and browse the different satellite basemap providers). Add one to the map. Figure 28: The QMS buttons in the QGIS toolbar. If you do not have the QMS button in your toolbar go Plugins -&gt; Manage and Install Plugins and search ‘QuickMapServices’ to install it. Now we have a basemap and our points - let’s change the symbology of the points to better communicate the variation in EC. Right click on the point data in the layer window and go Properties -&gt; Symbology. Set the symbol type to Graduated and specifying the values to graduate by as our EC column. Now set the Method to Size, and the Mode to Natural Breaks (Jenks), click Classify. Figure 29: Changing the symbology of our point data. Now when you click Apply the point size is weighted to the EC. You can further refine your symbology by changing the point colours and size - think about how best to communicate variation in EC. Finally, create a map output by clicking the New Layout button in the toolbar. If you aren’t familiar with creating maps in QGIS work with one of your classmates who is, or read through the second half of this tutorial. Figure 30: Example map from your QGIS output. Time-series data for assessing groundwater levels and salinity You are provided with a spreadsheet that summarise the timeseries data collected by various agencies (e.g., UWA and DWER (via WIR)). This files includes numerous sheets with the following data notes : Weather: There was a “Baro” dataset, which is a UWA logger measuring atmospheric pressure, in kPa. We measure this as the water levels in the piezometers may vary due to atmospheric pressure fluctuations. For your report you do not need to present this, just bear in mind it was used to “correct” the piezometer water level data. The rainfall provided is from the nearby DPIRD South-Perth weather station. GW Levels: This includes the UWA piezometer level data (converted into mAHD) for the main wells: HW1, HW2, and HW3. Bore 7 is also included which is denoted as Jeremy on the map. GW Salinity: This has the UWA salinity measurements from inside the Piezometers. These data are in mS/cm. Helena River: River Corrected data is the water level of Helena River under the nearby Traffic Bridge. So you can think of this as the water level at the river-end of the piezometer transect. “Poison Lease” (upstream in Helena River to the east of our site). It also has the discharge (Q) at this site, based on a rating curve. Swan River: This has WIR data from the station MSB data as above, including the daily min and mix, showing the tidal amplitude of the Swan River over time. The “Vitox” Salinity data is from the WIR website for the nearby location which is just to the west of our site (on the other side of Kings Meadow Oval). This data indicates the river/estuary salinity and would be very similar to the salinity of the surface water in Helena River near our site also. Note its seasonality, compared to the groundwater. Remember, when working with groundwater data you need to be careful to distinguish between groundwater levels that are reported as a depth to water (from the ground level or top of casing) as opposed to groundwater levels the Australian Height Datum (AHD). If there are measured values of depth to water you need to convert these to elevations in m AHD so they can be compared with the prior data and WIR data. To do this we need to know the ground level elevation at the measurement point, in mAHD (or the elevation of the top of casing, if this was the origin for the measurement). Raw data is often not perfect, so think of some ways to presnet the data. For example, you could make a PIVOT table to look at monthly values. When interpreting the data we would like to highlight seasonality, and also relative differences between sites. Importantly, is there a way to bring togteher the different data into a single plot to help our interpretation of the what is happening at the system. Conceptualising Surface-Groundwater interaction Now that you have an understanding of the previous studies at the site, and have plotted the existing data, the next step is to develop your conceptual model of surface water - groundwater interaction. When trying to make sense of all this data from different locations and time periods some guiding questions can help focus your analyses: How does salinity vary across the surface water sites? How does this relate to sources of water (Helena River, Stormwater from nearby suburbs, Swan estuary, Rain) How does water level and salinity vary in the groundwater based on distance from the river? Are levels in the aquifer higher or lower than the (mean) river level? What about salinity? Do these patterns in groundwater salinity change seasonally? Which flow pathways drive the changes we see? Is water moving vertically or laterally? Consider how water levels in the piezometers vary relative to surface water. Think here Darcy’s Law and Hydraulic gradient. Are is the unsaturated zone (vadose zone) adequate for the tree roots? i.e., is the water table depth deep enough to contain non-salty soil moisture for them, or must they rely on water from salty groundwater? Look here at areas in nearmap where tree loss has occurred. What are the salinity tolerances reported for E. rudis, based on lab/field trials? And how does our data compare to sort of data (historical and our class data).
