"],["E1A.html", "Exercise 1 – Spatial rainfall variability Introduction Objective Methods Activity Conclusions", " Exercise 1 – Spatial rainfall variability Introduction A fundamental of hydrology is working out how much rain turns into streamflow. But rain does not fall evenly over a catchment area and there are many factors that affect the extent to which the measured rainfall amount at one rain-gauge can be extended to the surrounding area: the distance from the rain-gauge to the centre of the representative area, the size of the area, the topography, the nature of the rainfall quantity (storm event, daily, monthly), the characteristics of the local storm patterns (convective versus low intensity events). Most hydrological analysis at the catchment scale requires knowledge of the areal distribution of precipitation in the form of an average depth (mm) of water for the entire catchment over a specified time period, using information from a set of unevenly placed rain-gauges spread around the area. In order to calculate the flow discharge produced by a large storm (convective type) in the catchment, it is necessary to calculate the average depth of rainfall (ADR) over the catchment. Three approaches are currently used for estimating the total rainfall: an arithmetic average of gauged quantities, the isohyetal method, and the Thiessen polygon method. Objective In this exercise you will compare these three different approaches for calculating the ADR and estimate the amount of runoff generated by a single rainfall event. Methods In this exercise you are required to calculate the average rainfall (ADR) over the entire catchment using: the arithmetic mean (considering only stations within the catchment boundary), the Thiessen polygon weighting system, and the Isohyetal method. Rainfall data for each station in the catchment is provided in Table 1. You are then required to produce an estimate of catchment runoff, which we will assume is equal to the stream discharge out of the catchment (\\(Q\\)). Recall from lecture slides that a rough estimate of runoff may be estimated using the total rainfall over the catchment during a given period of time, and a runoff coefficient. Figure 1: A depth of rain (\\(P\\), mm/day) is falling over a catchment area (\\(A\\), km2) to produce stream discharge (\\(Q\\), m3/day). Arithmetic Average The most basic measure of average rainfall depth is the arthimetic average, whereby you sum the observed rainfall at each rain gauge inside the catchment and divide by the number of gauges. Theisson Polygon Method The average depth of rainfall (ADR) over the entire catchment can be calculated using: \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathrm{ADR\\ (mm)\\ =\\ }\\frac{\\sum{ (A_i\\ast P_i)}}{\\sum A_i} \\tag{1} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(A_{i}\\) is the polygon area (km2), \\(P_{i}\\) is the rainfall (mm) corresponding to the \\(i\\) polygon, and \\(\\sum{A_{i}}\\) is the catchment area (km2). Isohyetal Method The average depth of rainfall over the entire catchment can be calculated using: \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathrm{ADR\\ (mm)\\ =\\ }\\frac{\\sum{(A_i\\ast P_i})}{\\sum A_i} \\tag{2} \\end{equation}\\] where in this method \\(A_{i}\\) is the area between isohyets \\(P_{i}\\) and \\(P_{i+1}\\) (km2), \\(P_{i}\\) is the average rainfall (mm) corresponding to the area \\(A_{i}\\) between the isohyets, and \\(\\sum{A_{i}}\\) is the total catchment area (km2). Activity Download the answer sheet for this exercise by clicking the download button in the tool bar . You are given the measured data for each rainfall gauge in Table 1. Calculate the arithmetic mean and write this in your summary table (Table 3). Next work out the ADR based on the other two methods. Figure 2: Catchment map, station locations, and isohyetal map for a storm event. Isoheytal map corresponds to rainfall total over a 24hr period. Thiessen Polygons: Sketch the polygons To construct the Thiessen polygons, first draw dashed straight lines between the gauges. Next, find the mid-points of each of these lines and draw another solid line, perpendicular to the dashed line. These solid lines drawn perpendicular to the dashed lines will meet to form irregular polygons Figure 3: Gridded map for polygon construction and area estimates.

Remember the relationship between rainfall and discharge as outlined in the supporting lecture.

This exercise is focused on i) accessing rainfall data (in Australia), ii) undertaking statistical analysis of the data, and then iii) seeking to understand WHY we see variability in rainfall amounts. Note that this exercise forms the first out of three sessions associated with your Assignment 1A. You will be required to share a summary of your data to a compiled version of the class data, which will be needed in subsequent exeercises to complete your assignment. Objective By the end of this activity, you should: Be able to source rainfall, understand the nature of that data, perform tasks to summarise the data, and describe it using simple statistics in Excel. Understand how and why rainfall may be changing over time and use statistics and regression to test this hypothesis. Know how different modes of climate variability such as IOD and ENSO can affect annual rainfall. Sourcing Rainfall Data The previous exercise focused on estimating rainfall and runoff at catchment scales during a single (daily) storm event. In this exercise we will learn how to access long time-series of rain data, and examine the nature of rainfall data and use some simple statistics in Excel to describe these data. 1) Start by downloading the daily rainfall data for a chosen BOM site from the Bureau of Meteorology web site. Choose a site of interest in Western Australia. Use the site ID to get the data as below. Download and extract the zipped file to get a CSV file that you can then open in Excel. Before moving forward with our analysis of this site, just open the dataset and make sure the site has a suitable period of data. Ideally, we need to be choosing a site with &gt;30 years of data - the more the better. Also, refer to the “Data available for the selected station” small infographic on the site-selection panel to check what (complete) years of data you have. Statistical Properties of Rainfall Data 2) Now, let’s plot the time series of DAILY rainfall. Clean up the plot as required and add to your activity sheet. Describe the main features of this data set. Consider: what is the most appropriate type of graph for rainfall data (bar, scatter, line)? 3) Calculate the annual SUM of rainfall, for each year. But note, we want to ensure that there are only whole years to calculate the sums or else the incomplete years will be in error (the sum will be artificially low due to missing data). We can do this without having to delete rows by making a PIVOT table. 3a) To explore each year’s data, select the required data across multiple columns (year column C to rainfall amount column F). Then click insert PIVOT table (select “Create a new tab” when prompted). Select Year and Rainfall amount as the FIELDS. Drag the Year FIELD into the ROWS box. (If it appears, left click on the “Sum of Year” in the VALUES box and remove it). You can select “COUNT” as the operation on the rainfall values to see how many entries are given for each year. Years with more than 10% of days missing (e.g &lt;330 days counted per year), are unreliable to include in our analysis so see if your station has any incomplete years. Now add the Rainfall to the VALUES box again, but this time make the operation on the data the a SUM. 3b) Once you are satisfied which years have good data, plot the annual sums as a timeseries. Clean up the plot of the annual sum of rainfall as required (and labels etc). What are the main features of this annual data set? What variability can you see? 4) Now we have a “clean” dataset, we want to explore some statistics. Use the Data Analysis add-in to calculate descriptive statistics (mean annual rainfall, max annual rainfall, min annual rainfall, Standard deviation of annual rainfall, Skewness) for the whole data (you can install by going to Tools-&gt;Add-ins-&gt;Analysis ToolPack). 5) Next, let’s look at the distribution of the rainfall data. Do this by plotting a histogram of the rainfall data (you will need to decide on a reasonable bin size) and plotting the cumulative probability distribution (you can ask Excel to generate this automatically when it makes the histogram, or generate it manually – each data point represents a probability of 1/#data points). What do these plots tell you about the rainfall data? Are the data normally distributed? 6a) Plot the seasonal (monthly average) rainfall. Use a PIVOT table again. Insert PIVOT table (select OK to create a new tab). Select Month and Rainfall amount as the FIELDS; drag the Month FIELD into the ROWS box. Left click on the “Sum of Month” in the VALUES box and remove it. Plot the annual sums as a timeseries. Clean up the plot as required. 6b) Copy the results to the class shared EXCEL sheet, where you will be completing a table that looks something like Table 4. for your site (and others when they are done). Describe the values you got and what they mean. How “useful” are these statistics for your understanding of the system? What if any assumptions are there about these statistics? 6c) Looking at your site and others from around Western Australia, how would you describe the seasonal pattern of rainfall (hint consider the climate type)? What factors may influence it (hint, think about earth orbit)? Table 4: Example Bureau of Meteorology Automatic Weather Station data for various station IDs across WA. You will need to complete a row in the online table for your site [refer to file on Teams].

Now we have explored the basic statistics of the rainfall time-series (including describing mean, variance, and seasonality), lets investigate if there are any long-term trends. 7a) For your chosen site, calculate the trend in rainfall for the last 5 years. Either copy and paste the annual totals from the PIVOT table (include the year and amount columns) to a new location for plotting or calculate manually. Select the last 5 years of data and in DATA ANALYSIS start a REGRESSION. Input the data range for x (the independant variable) and y (the dependant variable). Select “Line Fit Plots”. What did you find and what were you expecting for your site? Is this long enough for a reliable trend? Is the relationship really linear? (You can do this same analysis by adding a trend-line to the data, as described below). 7b) OK, so 5 years is not really useful fro trend assessment. Let’s now calculate the trend in rainfall for all years available at your chosen site. You can calculate that annual total rainfall using a PIVOT table (include the year and Rainfall amount columns) or by calculating them manually using SUM. Select the all years of data and INSERT a SCATTER plot. Add a linear trend line and “display the equation” on the chart. The slope of the equation of the line tells you the trend. Add the Pearson correlation coefficient (\\(r^2\\)) value as well to see how well the line fits the data (1 is a perfect fit, 0 is no fit). 7c) As before, add the information you have computed for your site into shared spreadsheet, which will have headings as per Table 5 and. Table 5: Bureau of Meteorology Automatic Weather Station data and station ID across WA and SWWA. Complete the table for each site.

Using the full temporal dataset (all years), perform a REGRESSION analysis using the ToolPak regeression option. These results inclue a t-statistic (t Stat) and p-value, which tell us if the trend is statistically significant. Please also enter them also into the shared spreasheet, such as shown in Table 5. The null hypothesis is the the rainfall did NOT change over time. If the p-value is smaller than alpha = 0.05 then we can REJECT the null hypothesis (which means that the rainfall amount has changed significantly over time). You can also reject the null hypothesis if the t-statistic is less than -2.101 or greater than 2.101 (based on a normal distribution). Describe the results and conclusions of this analysis. Explaining the interannual variability OK, so we have looked at the long term trend, but we do see year-to-year variability in annual totals. We can think about WHY do we see this variation - is it just random, or is it related to specific features of the climate system. So, here we determine how rainfall correlates with known modes of climate variability (i.e., Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). We use climatic indicators of these phenonemna to explore the temporal variability (look for cyclic patterns). In particular, we want to know if rainfall totals correlate with known modes of climate variability (i.e. for ENSO we use the Southern Oscillation Index, SOI). The SOI is calculated as follows. \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{SOI} = 10 \\frac{P_{\\text{diff}} - P_{\\text{diffav}}}{SD(P_{\\text{diff}})} \\tag{3} \\end{equation}\\] where: \\(P_{\\text{diff}}\\) = (average Tahiti MSLP for the month) - (average Darwin MSLP for the month) \\(P_{\\text{diffav}}\\) = long term average of \\(P_{\\text{diff}}\\) for the month in question, and \\(SD(P_{\\text{diff}})\\) = long term standard deciation of \\(P_{\\text{diff}}\\) for the month in question. IOD is calculated by anomalous Sea Surface Temperature gradient between the western equatorial Indian Ocean (50E-70E and 10S-10N) and the south eastern equatorial Indian Ocean (90E-110E and 10S-0N) in units of degrees Kelvin, denoted the DMI. We will use the extremely useful Climate Explorer for the next section. First you will need to register so you can save data series. Access the rainfall from the previous site that you used in the previous section. Click on “Monthly Station Data” (right hand menu), select “precipitation” from the “GHCN-M (all)” column, search for your station (e.g. type BROOME in the “Select stations” section), and then press “Get stations”. If the selection works you will see relevant stations listed, and then click “get data”. You will then see graphs and options for further integrating the data. Make a name to save the data (the default should be fine). Click “Add to list”. Now get the first climate index for the IOD called the DMI. Go to “Monthly climate indices” and then select DMI. Note any trend and variability in the index. To correlate the index and rainfall select “Correlate with other time series”. And tick your previously saved rainfall timeseries and then press “Correlate” and copy the results into Table 6 and the appropriate tab in the online spreadsheet. Table 6: Rainfall and climate indices (DMI for IOD and SOI for ENSO) correlations. Month DMI Corr DMI p-value SOI Corr SOI p-value Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Highlight any months that have a significant p-value (&lt;0.05). What relationships do you see between rainfall and climate mode and why? Do they correlate in specific seasons? How strong are these correlations really? How are they consistent or different across WA? We can do the same exercise except using gridded data (climate data divided into say 0.5 degree spacing using reanalysis information) to investigate the whole of Australia. Click on “Monthly observations” and go to Precipitation CRU TS 0.5. We then want to correlate each grid cell on the earth with our climate index (SOI and DMI) to see how the correlations very spatially. Click on “Correlate with a time series” and choose either SOI or DMI. Then click correlate at the bottom and wait (the calculations are being done online and the graph returned for viewing). Do the same for both SOI and DMI. For DMI which month had the highest (negative) correlation (copy that plot to your results). What areas of Australia have significant correlations and what time of year? For SOI which month had the highest (positive) correlation (copy that plot to your results). What areas of Australia have significant correlations and what time of year? Does this match with your own rainfall station correlations? "],["E3.html", "Exercise 3 – Drivers of streamflow B. Getting Streamflow Data C. Relationship between rainfall and runoff", " Exercise 3 – Drivers of streamflow … this is a continuation of the work in Exercise 2. B. Getting Streamflow Data In your Assessment 1A we will need to examine the relationship between annual rainfall and annual streamflow (aka runoff) for a chosen catchment. Streamflow data is recently reported on the BOM website for some rivers, but the measurement of streamflow is a State Government responsibility. To get streamflow data, go the Department of Water web site. Use this WIR tool to locate a gauging station near your rainfall site. Add the site to your cart and submit a data request - check that the data is being delivered as a “package of pre-computed reports”. You will then be emailed a zip file of the station’s data. Ensure the station has 10-20 years of available data for this exercise. Once you have the data, explore the CSV file received to see the nature of the data provided - i.e., river flow discharge rate. Can you use the techniques introduced above to summarise the data (e.g., create a PIVOT table)? C. Relationship between rainfall and runoff Now lets examine the relationship between annual rainfall and annual streamflow (also called discharge by surface hydrologists). Go to the Department of Water web site and download the streamflow data closest to your rainfall stations to examine this relationship (Refer to the Exercise 2 activity for details on how to source the data - make sure the site you have chosen has streamflow data by checking the data availability and the request the report for water levels and flow - continuous to get the flow data). (If WIR website is not working, a file for Walyunga (Avon River) is available via the download button : Walyunga_139985.zip) Plot a scatter plot of annual streamflow (y-axis) and annual rainfall (x-axis). Add a trendline to the chart. What are the relationships between rainfall and streamflow? Are they linear or non-linear and why? Add the data for your site to the online spreadsheet so we can look at the whole data set - are there consistent relationships across WA? If not, explain the variation. "],["E4a.html", "Exercise 4 – Data synthesis Spatial patterns in rainfall Submission", " Exercise 4 – Data synthesis … this is a continuation of the work in Exercise 2 &amp; 3. In this activity we will explore the nature of rainfall and runoff data. Rainfall is influenced by a number of processes that operate on different space and time scales (see Figure 5). We first examine these during this exercise and then we explore how different modes of climate variability affect patterns in annual rainfall. Lastly, we look to see if we can find a relationship between rainfall and streamflow (assumed equal to runoff). To achieve this, we use a large number of weather stations across WA to quantify the variability of rainfall in space and time. In this assignment you will work to explore data from an individual site. You will then share with class members the results from your site so we can build a more complete picture. We will be sharing our data using an online spreadsheet. Please make sure that you upload your data as soon as possible so that others can include it in their analysis.

Spatial patterns in rainfall Inspect the results of everyone’s analysis for Table 5 Google Sheets version. Which station(s) have a statistically significant slope. Are there statistically significant changes in rainfall? Are they consistent across WA? What may be causing the changes? Take the information in Table 5 (Google Sheets version) and record the values onto a map of Western Australia. Now think about the spatial patterns rather than the temporal ones (i.e climate modes). What spatial patterns might you expect and what do you notice? What may be causing these spatial patterns? Submission Your submission for this assessment is a summary report outlining the results of the analysis and questions posed in questions 1-8, above. This should include the figures and tables you created, summarising the data from your chosen site and the broader class data-set. Your report should have a title and the information should be grouped into numbered headings and sub-headings, like a scientific journal article. Start with an introduction, then you will have 4 data sections: 1) temporal trends in rainfall, 2) spatial patterns in rainfall, 3) interannual variability in rainfall and 4) relationships between rainfall and runoff. Finally, you should write a conclusion that summarizes the main findings and links back to the objectives you stated in your introduction. Make sure that all the text in your figures is legible. For charts, all axes should be clearly labeled and units given where appropriate. Make sure to include appropriate captions to describe your tables and figures, and cite these in the text (Figure captions go below the figure. Table captions go above the table). You will be assessed according to the rubric provided on LMS. Be sure to submit your report via the Turnitin Link on LMS by the due date and time.

"],["E4.html", "Exercise 5 - Visualising groundwater Learning Objectives Groundwater flow rates Using Darcy’s Law to calculate flow to a stream Creating a flow net Physical model of groundwater system Computer model of groundwater system Example calculation of groundwater baseflow to a river", " Exercise 5 - Visualising groundwater Learning Objectives In this exercise you will investigate what controls the direction and rate of groundwater flow, and investigate groundwater storage and flow within a layered groundwater system. At the completion of this exercise students will be able to calculate groundwater flow rates describe the range of flow rates within natural groundwater systems and explain the key factors controlling these rates identify patterns of groundwater flow and hydraulic head contours within layered groundwater systems Groundwater flow rates As a first step lets consider the flux law for groundwater flow. Groundwater flow is driven by the distribution of water pressure (hydraulic head, which has units of length) within the groundwater system. The flow of groundwater follows a flux law; \\[\\begin{equation} q=\\frac{Q}{A}=-K \\frac{\\Delta h}{\\Delta l} \\tag{4} \\end{equation}\\] Where \\(q\\) is the specific discharge (or Darcy Flux) with units of L T-1, \\(Q\\) is the volumetric flow rate (L3 T-1), \\(A\\) is the cross-sectional area through which the water flow (L2), and \\(\\frac{\\Delta h}{ \\Delta l}\\) is the hydraulic gradient. This gradient is simply the change in water pressure (\\(h_1-h_2\\)) over a given distance (L/L, unitless). The key system property in this flux law is the hydraulic conductivity (\\(K\\)), which has units of L T-1. In natural groundwater systems the value of hydraulic conductivity can vary over 12 orders of magnitude. Even though this water flux \\(q\\) has units of L T-1, it’s not actually the velocity of the groundwater, because the water wasn’t flowing through the whole area, just the pore space. To correct for this and calculate the average velocity we need to use the area of the pore space (\\(An\\), where \\(n\\) is porosity), instead of the total area. This gives us; \\[\\begin{equation} \\bar{v}=\\ \\frac{Q}{An}=-\\frac{K}{n} \\frac{\\Delta h}{\\Delta l} \\tag{5} \\end{equation}\\] Where \\(\\bar{v}\\) is the average linear velocity of the water flowing through the porous media. Now that we know these simple equations let’s look at some experimental data from simple “Darcy tubes” that allow us to measure the relationships between rates of groundwater flow, hydraulic gradients and the hydraulic conductivity of the porous media that it flows through. This is how the idea of a “hydraulic conductivity” was first defined, empirically, and it was only decades later that the physical basis for hydraulic conductivity and Darcy’s Law was fully elucidated from first principles (see Hubbert 1940 for some light bedtime reading). Figure 6: a) Photo of simple Darcy Tube and b) diagram showing terms in Darcy’s Law Equation Let’s have a go at using this experimental setup to estimate the hydraulic conductivity of different sedimentary materials. To do this all we need to do is measure the flow rate through the tube for our chosen porous media. For each porous material, the slope determines the hydraulic gradient and we just need to measure the volume that flows out of the tube over a set time interval. During this experiment; the diameter of the tubes was 40 mm the inlet at the top of the tube was 25 cm above the outlet at the bottom of the tube, and the lateral distance between the inlet and the outlet was 0.5 m Over a period 24 hours 168 mL was collected from the tube filled with sand, 3.6 mL was collected from the tube filled with silty sand, and 814 mL of water was collected from the tube filled with gravel. Based on this information you can rearrange Eq (10) to calculate the hydraulic conductivity of each porous media. Are you results consistent with the range of values for similar porous media in the literature? Could you measure the hydraulic conductivity of a clay sample using this experimental setup? What could you do to improve this experiment? Using Darcy’s Law to calculate flow to a stream Now we understand the concept of Darcy’s Law within a small-scale context, lets think about how we can apply it in the “real world”. The below diagram shows the flow in an aquifer towards a stream. Figure 7: Water table and topography of a idealised hillslope Consider the digram above. If the slope of the water table hydraulic gradient perpendicular to the stream is on average approximately 1/1000 (m/m), what is the Darcy flux, q, of groundwater towards the river? Use a hydraulic conductivity, K, of 1 m /day. Creating a flow net We can trace the path of a “parcel” of water at any point in a groundwater system by creating a “flow net”. To do this we map the lines of “equipotential” (i.e., lines of constant head), like height contours on a topographic map, but instead of land height, its water height. Based on the gradient in water height (hydraulic gradient) we can work out the path that a parcel of wtare would take, as water will flow from high to low pressure. Before we go further, lets check out this cool flow-net tool called “TopoDrive” . This is an online interactive tool that allows you to visulise groundwater flow nets! Figure 8: Creating a hillslope flow-net. For an overview, check out this youtube instruction video here. Create a hypothetical hillslope water table cross-section with the tool. Use the tool to show the water flow pathways. Make a note of your observations - is there anythign unexpected? Depending on your flow-net you may be surprised that water does not always flow in a straight line! One thing to note with flow-lines (or sometimes we call them streamlines), water flow paths must cross lines of equipotetnial at right-angles (i.e. perpendicular). Now look at the below image - a plan view of the water table contours around Perth. Given the sort of hydraulic conductivities estimated above, what would the range of linear velocity we could expect in a groundwater system like the Gnangara Mound? Use the following watertable map (taken from Davidson and Yu 2008, HG20) to estimate a hydraulic conductivity, and then calculate linear velocity using Eq (11). You will need to assume a porosity - look these up, or just use 0.25 (which is a good indicative value for back-of-the-envelope calculations in aquifer materials - why not in clays?). Note that it’s probably ok to assume a porosity value because the range of porosity is within one order of magnitude, whereas hydraulic conductivity will vary by multiple orders of magnitude, even within the same type of material, so this will be the larger source of uncertainty in your calculation. Figure 9: Section of a map of the watertable across Perth Physical model of groundwater system In this part of the exercise we will look at a model of a layered groundwater system. Each layer has a different hydraulic conductivity, \\(K\\), forming two aquifers and an aquitard. Within each layer there will also be variation in hydraulic conductivity. This spatial variation is called “heterogeneity”, and it is an important feature of real groundwater systems. Start by annotating the photo of this model (Figure 9) to show the following; Aquifers and aquitards Recharge and discharge zones Water levels in each of the wells The water table Hydraulic head boundaries Figure 10: Physical model of a layered groundwater system. Now watch this video to see how water moves through the model when dye is injected to see the direction of groundwater flow. Does the flow direction vary spatially? Does the flow direction change over time? Draw arrows on the following screen-shot to show the direction of groundwater flow within the model domain. We have learnt that the measure of potential for groundwater flow is “hydraulic head” and we also know that groundwater flows from high hydraulic head to low hydraulic head. In fact, groundwater flow will be perpendicular to the equipotentials (lines of equal hydraulic head). Based on your inferred flow paths, try now to add in the hydraulic head contours (or equipotentials). It might help for you to think about topographic contours on a landscape map - in this case you have elevation contours, and if you placed a ball at the top of a hill it would roll (or flow) from the higher elevation to the lower elevation. As a general rule, we also know that flow through high conductivity layers will be primarily horizontal, and flow through low conductivity layers will be primarily vertical. Figure 11: Physical model of a layered groundwater system. What can you learn from this physical model about groundwater systems? By using the physical model we have been able to see directly in the subsurface, but in the real world, the only information we have would be the wells. If you only had the hydraulic head measurements in the wells what would you know about the groundwater system? What else would you need to know about this system to calculate groundwater flow velocities (and therefore contaminant transport)? How important is it that we understand the geology as well as having measurements of hydraulic heads? What else might you measure in a real groundwater system to get a fuller picture of what is happening? Computer model of groundwater system We can also run a “digital twin” of the physical model that we have built in the lab. For this activity we will now use the ParFlow Sandtank model. This is a computer model simulating groundwater flow, and allows users to change aquifer configurations and explore the essential features of groundwater and contaminant flow. Once you have watched the introductory video lets take a look at running the model. Navigate to this model website. You can learn how to customise the sandtank and run a simulation here. Have a go at manipulating the soil conditions and the hydraulic head sliders, and run simulations pumping or injecting groundwater. Can you reproduce our lab-based physical model? Example calculation of groundwater baseflow to a river In this section is an example of how we can apply Darcy’s Law to work out how an aquifer is “working”, i.e., how much water it is conducting and entering the river as baseflow. Consider the following. After a prolonged period without rain, the discharge of a river at a measuring station A is 10 m3/s and at a downstream station B it is 15 m3/s. The distance between A and B is 2 km. Figure 12: Plan and cross sectional view of a river valley Between the stations, the river receives water from both sides, from an unconfined aquifer, and the equipotentials are assumed to be parallel to the river. The slope of the water table (hydraulic gradient) on average is approximately 1/1000 (m/m). Based on this information, use Darcy’s Law to determine the transmissivity of the aquifer, in m2/s. Note that, Transmissivity of an aquifer is the depth integrated hydraulic conductivity \\[\\begin{equation} Transmissivity = T = Aquifer Depth * K \\tag{6} \\end{equation}\\] Start by drawing a diagram and annotate with the information that you know. "],["E5.html", "Exercise 6 - Undertaking a water balance The water balance and principle of conservation 1D (vertical) water balance at the plot/landscape scale The water balance for a watershed The water balance for a wetland Tracking the volume of a lake over time", " Exercise 6 - Undertaking a water balance The water balance and principle of conservation The water balance concept is the most important conceptual framework we have in hydrology. At its simplest it is a basic accounting system able to resolve the inputs and outputs to a given ‘system’. A system could be a lake or reservoir, or a catchment, an agricultural field, or even a suburb in a city. In fact, we can do a water balance at the global scale. The approach can be expanded to undertake very detailed tracking of water sources and stores, termed water balance modelling. We have already relied on this concept implicitly when considering the Desktop Catchment data, such as how much rain entered, what the soil water storage was and how much water was discharged. Lets now consider this at the field scale. The fundamental equation for a water balance is : \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{Change in water storage} = \\text{Inputs} - \\text{Outputs} \\tag{7} \\end{equation}\\] or written more formally: \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{\\Delta S}{\\Delta t} = I - O \\tag{8} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(S\\) is the storage volume of water in the system of interest, \\(I\\) is the rate of water input, and \\(O\\) is the rate of water output. This is depicted schematically below. Sometimes we call the box (store) our ‘control volume’. the use of \\(\\Delta\\) means “change in . \\(\\Delta t\\), is the time-scale over which the storage change occurred. Figure 13: Conceptual depiction of the water balance So the concept is pretty simple, but the challenge we have is applying it to a particular context. Lets consider the landscape near to Perth. Figure 14: Water balance diagram for a landscape Here we can “tailor” the water balance concept to fit our application context. For example: \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{Runoff} = \\text{Precipitation} - \\text{Evapotranspiration} \\pm \\text{Storage changes} \\tag{9} \\end{equation}\\] In this case, storage changes is referring to any increase or decrease in surface stores of waters (like dams), but more likely in this case is large changes to the volume stored in groundwater; this would manifest as a increase or decrease in the water table elevation. 1D (vertical) water balance at the plot/landscape scale Let’s now consider a plot of land - this could be an ecosystem of interest we’re studying, or some agricultural land. You can also think of some other examples. The water balance can be more conveniently assumed to be “1D” (one-dimensional) - that is, we consider the upper soil for a generic unit of area, as per the below diagram. Figure 15: Water balance diagram for a landscape - in one-dimension (1D) In this case, we can formulate the water balance equation, over a time increment, as: \\[\\begin{equation} (P + I + U) - (ET + R + D + L) = \\Delta S \\tag{10} \\end{equation}\\] where: \\(P\\) = precipitation \\(U\\) = upward capillary flow \\(I\\) = irrigation additions \\(ET\\) = evapotranspiration \\(R\\) = runoff \\(D\\) = vertical drainage \\(L\\) = lateral drainage \\(\\Delta S\\) = change in soil water storage As it is 1-dimensional, we can use the units for this in \\(mm\\), which is usually more intuitive. This could be done for example on an annual or monthly time increment (remember \\(\\Delta t\\) = the time-step). Figure 16: Example monthly water balance components being used to determine times of water excess or deficit. The above can be tailored to a given situation, and shows how we can customise the approach to a given context. Example: Calculate the water balance for a hillslope Consider the following case-study. The soils in a very small drainage basin near Albany in WA are characterized by a clayey B horizon at 29 \\(cm\\) depth. At the beginning of a rainy day in September, the soil moisture deficit in the upper 29 \\(cm\\) of the soil equals -5 \\(mm\\). The rainfall amount was 27 \\(mm\\), with losses by canopy interception and evaporation estimated to be 9 \\(mm\\). At the end of the day the upper layer of soil is water-saturated. The contribution of throughflow to the brook discharge was estimated as being 11 \\(mm/day\\). All parts of the drainage basin contribute to the brook discharge and the B horizon may be regarded as water-impermeable Based on this information, how much overland flow (in units of \\(mm\\)) occurred during the day? Start by sketching a catchment ‘bucket’ water balance diagram, and then annotate with the relevant information. The water balance for a watershed The above 1D approach is convenient for catchments that are spatially homogeneous. For larger, more complex catchments we can expand the approach to consider the different water stores and how water is redistributed. Water balance modelling software can be employed to undertake this. This software can support water resource management decisions and planning. Figure 17: Components of a catchment water balance The water balance for a wetland A common activity is to undertake a water balance assessment for a waterbody, like a wetland, lake, river or estuary. Take a look at the below diagram for a wetland. Figure 18: Components of a wetland water balance. Source:USGS Water Supply Paper 2425 In this case, try to write down the water balance consistent with the above notation. Consider how would we measure the different input and output terms? Example: Calculate the water balance for an irrigation dam Consider the following case-study. A land-holder wants to understand if a small dam will hold water throughout a season. Figure 19: An irrigation dam. How long will this water last?! 2a) You have measured an annual average decline in water level due to evaporation of \\(7 mm/day\\) in a small dam (the average of higher values during the summer months and lower during winter). Assuming that the dam is sealed but leaks an additional \\(~1 mm/day\\) to the sub-surface, and that the starting depth is \\(4m\\), what is the time-scale (in days) for the dam to dry out, assuming an average annual rainfall of \\(431 mm\\)? (Hint: First define all the input and outputs, and then re-arrange the water balance equation for time) 2b) If an amount of \\(5.8mm/day\\) was extracted for irrigation, would the dam last a whole year before drying? Tracking the volume of a lake over time Lets now consider a simple “bucket” storage model of how a lake level fluctuates through time. This is a modified version of an exercise from Wainwright and Mulligan (2002) (see p38). Similar types of models have been used for paleo-environmental reconstructions (Bradley 1999) and in hillslope hydrology (Dunin 1976), where the bucket represents the ability of soil to hold water. This type of approach can also be used to simulate solute concentrations, which is particularly useful for quantifying exchanges between surface water and groundwater (Cook 2013). 0.0.1 Defining the system In this activity you will use a simple “bucket” storage model to simulate changes in lake water level through time. The depth of the lake increases due to rainfall and inflows and decreases due to evaporation and seepage (Figure 13). There is also a maximum level to which the lake can be filled, \\(h_{\\text{max}}\\) (m), above which water will overflow from the lake, such that \\(0\\le h\\le h_{\\text{max}}\\). This simple system is described by the equation; \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{dh}{dt}= r+i-e-kh \\tag{11} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(r\\) is the rate of rainfall (m yr-1), \\(i\\) is the rate of water inflow from rivers and runoff (m yr-1), \\(e\\) is the rate of evaporation from the lake (m yr-1), and \\(kh\\) is the seepage rate from the base of the lake (infiltration to the underlying aquifer), which is assumed to be a linear function of the depth of water in the lake, \\(h\\) (m). This seepage is controlled by the coefficient \\(k\\) (yr-1), which describes the permeability of the lake bed. Before proceeding, satisfy yourself that you understand this equation and that each term in this equation has the same units, as required. Figure 20: Conceptual model of lake water balance. Surface waters can be either gaining (groundwater discharge to streams and lakes), losing (recharge of aquifers by streams and lakes), or through-flow systems (Winter et al. 1998). Based on the information you have, what type of lake (gaining, losing or through-flow) is the system shown in Figure 13? What other data might you want to measure to confirm this? Activity: Simulating the system The above water balance equation, (11), is a differential equation, that describes the rate of change of water level over time. We know that \\(\\frac{dh}{dt}\\) is technically the instantaneous rate of change of lake water level. But calculus tells us that we can approximate \\(\\frac{dh}{dt}\\) by calculating the change in water level over small increments of time, with the most accurate approximation using the smallest increments of time. So we have an equation for the rate of change in lake water level (Equation (11)). But how do we calculate the lake level as a function of time, \\(h(t)\\)? That is, how do we solve the above balance equation to calculate \\(h\\) for any given time? To do this we use an iterative approach. Start with an initial lake level, \\(h_{i}\\), and then calculate the change in lake level over each small increment of time (in this case \\(dt = 1\\) year is fine), using the rates for each process. The water level at the next time-step is then calculated by summing the initial level and the calculated change; \\(h_{i+1} = h_{i} + \\text{inputs} - \\text{outputs}\\). Figure 21: Simulated lake level under three different model scenarios (A, B and C). 3) Lets now open Excel and see if we can reproduce the above results. Use the below numbers as input. Start with a lake level of \\(10m\\) and see if you can work out which set of parameters matches which line. Table 7: Model parameters for lake level simulations shown in Figure 2.

Understanding land cover and land use within a catchment is critical to support management. Figure 22: Yule Brook catchment land cover pattern. Yule Brook catchment background Building a complete view of a catchment is often complicated by having to deal with a diversity of geospatial data. Dr. Daniel Paraska has been working on catchment assessment for all the catchments in the Swan-Canning river basin in collaboration with the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions (DBCA) and the Centre for Water Sensitive Cities. He shares with us a video below providing some background to the Yule Brook Catchment, one of the “Reporting Catchments” for the Swan-Canning system, and introduces this activity about using GIS to help build our understanding.

Go to Google Earth or Google Maps and compare the shapefile with the aerial photos of the same spots. Consider whether they are as clear as the shapefile indicates. Are they filled with water or are they dry? Do they cross roads or follow roads? Check the hydrological subcatchments. Do they match the drainage lines well? Are there any subcatchments that are not well represented? Land cover Set your labels and colours so that they make nice images that communicate the permeability and interception of the landscape.

Zoom in on a few areas and assess how accurate the layer is. It should be good but not perfect. Select a few broad areas and describe how infiltration and interception would be different in these areas. Land use Similarly to how you edited the land cover data, edit the land use layer so that it displays the land use in a meaningful way. Set the symbology to display LAND_CAT (Layer Properties &gt; Symbology &gt; Categorized &gt; Classify). Check this layer against Google Earth and determine its accuracy.

"],["E8.html", "Exercise 8 – Lake nutrient assessment Indicators of wetland health Water quality attributes of interest Turning data into information Wetland data case study : Yellagonga Quantifying wetland function Getting further info on wetlands", " Exercise 8 – Lake nutrient assessment Indicators of wetland health Indicators of wetland health include dissolved oxygen, pH, salinity, temperature, turbidity and colour; measuring these parameters over time is used to monitor the result of any threats to ecosystem health. For example, turbidity is used as a measure (indicator) of potential excessive sediment in the water column that may result in either in sedimentation or reduce light penetration (the specific threat). Turbidity measures the potential for an impact, whereas a more direct measure of impact would be actually measuring light penetration - however this is more time consuming and difficult so us not generally undertaken. Water quality attributes of interest A summary of the suite of measurements we make to measure an aquatic system include: Dissolved oxygen, \\(DO\\) or \\(O_2\\) : is a measure of the concentration of oxygen gas dissolved in water. Oxygen can be generated from photosynthesis within a wetland, mixed into surface waters from the atmosphere or imported from river inflows. It is is consumed by organism respiration. Turbidity : is a measure of the clarity of water. As suspended particulate matter including clay, silt, detritus and plankton in the water increases, the clarity decreases and the water takes on a muddy appearance. Turbidity does not measure the quantity of suspended matter in the water, just its effects on clarity. pH : The pH of water is a measure of its acidity or alkalinity. The actual component of the water being measured is its concentration of hydrogen ions (H+). In water, some of the H2O molecules will dissociate into H+ ions (also called protons) and OH- ions (hydroxide). When there are more H+ ions than OH- ions the water will have a pH below 7 and is acidic. Conversely, when there are more OH- ions than H+ ions the water has a pH greater than 7 and is alkaline. When the pH of a water body is 7, the H+ concentration is the same as the concentration of hydroxide (OH-) ions and is neutral. When the water is approximately neutral, it is called circum-neutral. Colour : The colour of water results from the combination of dissolved and suspended substances. These include metals e.g. iron and manganese, dissolved organic matter e.g. humus and peat materials, plankton e.g. diatoms and Cyanobacteria, colloidal substances e.g. carbonates and clays and industrial wastes. Turbidity, even at low levels, will make the apparent colour higher than the true colour. The true colour of a water sample can be measured after removing all suspended material. Salinity, \\(S\\) : Salinity is the amount of salt dissolved in the water. There are many salts dissolved in water, most notable sodium chloride. The amount of salt in the water can be measured directly by evaporating the water from a known volume of water and weighing the residual. However this is time consuming. A solution of salt will conduct electricity, and the amount it conducts depends on the concentration of the dissolved salts, the conductivity in a solution increases as the amount of salts dissolved in the water increases. Electrical Conductivity (EC) uses this characteristic to estimate the levels of salinity. The units of EC in water are usually expressed as micro Siemens per centimetre (μS/cm). Nitrogen, \\(N\\) : is a key nutrient in an aquatic ecosystem and made up of : Total Nitrogen \\(TN\\) Dissolved Organic Nitrogen \\(DON\\) Nitrate \\(NO_3\\) Ammonium \\(NH_4\\) Phosphorus, \\(P\\) : is a key nutrient in an aquatic ecosystem and made up of : Total Phosphorus, \\(TP\\): Dissolved Organic Phosphorus \\(DOP\\) Phosphate, \\(PO_4\\) : Chlorophyll-a, \\(Chl-a\\) Heavy metals Micropollutants Faecal coliforms Turning data into information Data are the measurements you take that represent the condition or health of the environment at that time. The environmental conditions in an aquatic ecosystem will change over time, at least seasonally but often daily. A suite of data covering a range of indicators of condition taken only on one occasion can tell you about condition at that time only. This is often called a snapshot of the condition. Data collected from several occasions begins to tell you about variability and change over time. As data accumulate, seasonal and longer term changes will be discovered and confidence will increase. Data needs to be analysed and interpreted to provide information. A good quality long term data set will assist in providing good information, but understanding and achieving good wetland management only occurs when the data is correctly interpreted. Guidelines and thresholds One approach is to compare data and data summaries to water quality guidelines (objectives or targets). Guidelines are available in the National Water Quality Guidelines (ANZECC &amp; ARMCANZ, 2000), and State policies are also of assistance in interpreting water quality data. The Australian and New Zealand Environment Conservation Council (ANZECC) published the widely used Australian and New Zealand guidelines for fresh and marine water quality in 2000. These guidelines, which are usually called the ‘ANZECC guidelines’ and are available on the internet at www.deh.gov.au/water/quality/nwqms, provide government and the community – especially regulators, industry, consultants, community groups and catchment and water managers – with a framework for conserving ambient water quality in our rivers, lakes, estuaries and marine waters. Linking water quality indicators to environmental values ‘Environmental values’ are those values or uses of water that the community believes are important for a healthy ecosystem – for public benefit, welfare, safety or health. These include, but are not limited to, protection of aquatic ecosystems, drinking water, primary and secondary recreation, visual amenity, and agricultural water for irrigation, livestock and growing aquatic foods. The environmental values (and uses) of water apply to waterways such as natural rivers, creeks, lagoons, wetlands, lakes, groundwater, and estuarine and marine waters. The quality of artificial waterways such as reservoirs, where the waters are valued by the community for aquatic ecosystems or human uses, are also addressed by the guidelines, but enclosed and piped waters are excluded. For each environmental value, the guidelines identify particular water quality characteristics or ‘indicators’ that are used to assess whether the condition of the water supports that value. The presence of faecal coliforms, for example, is used as an indicator for recreational and drinking water quality, because this directly puts those uses at risk, but it is not an indicator for the protection of aquatic ecosystems. The ANZECC guidelines are a powerful tool that allows ambient water quality management to be an important element in decision-making for environment protection, land- use planning and natural resource management. The ANZECC guidelines advocate an ‘issues-based’ approach to assessing ambient water quality, rather than the application of rigid numerical criteria with no appreciation of the context. This means that the guidelines focus on: - the environmental values we are seeking to achieve or maintain - the outcomes being sought - the ecological and environmental processes that drive any water quality problem. For each environmental value of water, the ANZECC guidelines outline common ‘issues’ (or pressures) that may be a problem and provide ‘packaged’ solutions on how to deal with them. These common issues in waterways include such problems as algal blooms and salinity. Figure 25: Example relationship between values and indicators Trigger values Trigger values are fundamental to using the ANZECC guidelines. The trigger values for different indicators of water quality may be given as a threshold value or as a range of desirable values. Where an indicator is below the threshold value or within the desirable range for its trigger value in a particular waterway, the risk to the protection of the environmental value is low. Where an indicator is higher than the threshold value or outside the desirable range for its trigger value in a particular waterway, there may be a risk that the environmental value will not be protected. Figure 26: Trigger values show when a variable of interest exceeds a threshold There are standard recognised approaches for analysing and interpreting data that can provide comparison between different sites and systems, changes over time and an evaluation against guidelines and targets. Data can be summarised using basic statistical tools. Summary statistics A simple measure of the typical state of an aquatic ecosystem is to determine the central tendency of the data, often called the median or mean. The distribution of data is important in understanding central tendency. The graphs below show the data as a frequency distribution (that is the frequency or number of times a particular measurement was taken). Data may be evenly distributed (often called normal distribution) or can be skewed, with more measurements at one end of the range of results. Water quality data generally has a skewed distribution – most of the time the level is similar, and when there is a change in water quality data it is generally for a short period of time. For example, turbidity measurements are generally low in a healthy system when fresh water inflows are low. Or algae (chlorophyll-a) will be low until a bloom occurs. Figure 27: Example distributions of WQ data - normal (left) and skewed (right). Time-series trends As discussed above, variability is a natural part of the aquatic environment, and typically there is a 10-20 per cent difference between consecutive water quality measurements. There will be more substantial changes following floods, after long dry periods and after entrance opening. For example, turbidity may go up tenfold during a flood event. Displaying the data in a time series provides a picture of change over time. Time series plots are useful to illustrate seasonal patterns, major events or when one-off high or low levels are measured. Trend lines can also be added to time series graphs to establish if there have been substantial increases or decreases of parameters over time. For the clearest picture, a long time period is required to show changes. Usually less than five years will not provide a good assessment. Wetland data case study : Yellagonga Let’s explore the above ideas by analysing data from a case-study wetland. The Yellagonga wetlands within the Swan Coastal Plain (SCP) are a Groundwater Dependent Ecosystem (GDE) within the Cities of Joondalup and Wanneroo. Figure 28: Yellagonga (Lake Joondalup). A spreadsheet of historical monitoring data is available for download. Take a look through the data set and note: The number of variables The time frame of monitoring The number of monitoring sites Figure 29: WQ Monitoring Sites. What is the mean of the various water quality attributes? How does this compare between sites? (Hint: use column filtering and pivot tables to quickly summarise the data) Do any variables exceed guideline values? Often we are interested how nutrients are “partitioned” - that is, how the different nutrient species that make up total nitrogen or total phosphorus change over time. For a chosen site in the data-set, produce a “stacked area” time-series of \\(TN\\) and \\(TP\\). To do this you must compute the organic amount and then make a stacked graph of the components : Organic Nitrogen : \\(ON=TN-NO_3-NH_4\\) Organic Phosphorus : \\(OP=TP-PO_4\\) Looking at the nutrient trend over time for the chosen site, do you see any changes in either the total amount of nutrients or the bioavailable fraction? Quantifying wetland function Monitoring tells us about the state of an environmental system, but in some circumstances we are also interested in how a system is functioning. In the case of constructed or engineered wetlands our focus is on improving water quality by reducing nutrient concentrations. Wetlands act as a temporary store of water flowing through a river. They may filter out the hydrograph peak by slowing the flow down, and also they act as a “biogeochemical reactor” able to change the water chemistry in the river water as it moves through. Wetland retention time We can compute a characteristic time-scale of flow through a wetland, called the Hydraulic Residence Time, using this formula: Hydraulic Residence Time (\\(HRT\\), days) = \\(V_{wetland} / Q\\) where \\(V_{wetland}\\) is the wetland volume (m3) and can be approximated from wetland area and depth, and \\(Q\\) is the average flow going through the wetland (m3/day). If we assume the wetland is at steady-state (not changing volume rapidly) then \\(Q_{in} \\approx Q_{out}\\), and this can be assumed as the average flow through rate. Figure 30: Schematic of wetland flushing time calculation. For the Black Creek wetland (the one monitored on the Yule Brook catchment race), the area was estimated to be 3850 m2. If you assume a mean depth of 0.5 m, and a flow rate of 0.1 m3/s, what is the retention time of water at this site? The HRT estimate above assumes complete mixing in the wetland. For this site do you think that is the case? Figure 31: Black Creek wetland in the Yule Brook catchment, highlighting the inlet and outlet. How many nutrients can it assimilate? Nutrient assimilation efficiency The efficiency of a wetland to reduce nutrients (or suspended sediment or salt etc.) can be computed based on the ratio of the outlet to inlet nutrient concentration, corrected for an assumed background concentration. \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathrm{Removal\\ Efficiency\\ (\\%)\\ =\\ }1-\\frac{C_{out}-C_0}{C_{in}-C_0} \\times \\: 100 \\% \\tag{12} \\end{equation}\\] where: \\(C_0\\) is the ‘background’ concentration (the value expected in a “clean river”), \\(C_{in}\\) is the input concentration, \\(C_{out}\\) is the outlet concentration. The above expressions can be applied to all nutrients and contaminants, however, note the following when applying it: For attributes that are improving (e.g., \\(DO\\)) during their transit through the wetland, then the above fraction can be reversed. The value \\(C_0\\) needs to be realistic and smaller than \\(C_{out}\\). This value could be based on a value like form the ANZECC guidelines or based on a locally set target. Now do the following tasks: For the provided data set on Black Lake wetland (the one monitored on the Yule Brook catchment race), compute the efficiency using the above formula for the different nutrient species. Which ones improve the most? Using your knowledge of wetland processes, can you explain why some species are changing? List the potential processes contributing to the changes. Is their a relationship between \\(HRT\\) (i.e. the time the water is within the wetland) and the reduction efficiency? What could be done to improve water retention? Getting further info on wetlands There is a lot of information about wetlands online. The “WetlandInfo” pages managed by the Qld government is a great summary and information resource.

Classifying e-flow benefits case study : MDB Conclusions", " Exercise 11 - Assessing environmental flow impacts Objectives Use scenario assessment to identify the impacts of water diversion on a coastal lake system. Become familiar with basic spreadsheet commands in Excel by conducting an environmental flow analysis and building a simple impact model. What are environmental flows? Lakes, rivers and estuaries are adapted to receive water based on the natural hydrological condition, but often water is required upstream for other purposes. An environmental flow is water that is provided to the environment to maintain its health and natural diversity In simple terms: Provision of water to satisfy environmental requirements for ‘healthy’ (natural) function. Environmental flows are a form of river/wetland restoration. They are sometimes referred to as “e-flows”. In the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB), a water market was established that allows for irrigation entitlements to be “traded”; e-water must be bought from the “water holder” (in this case that is the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder, CEWH). Classifying e-flow benefits case study : MDB After viewing the 6 videos on LMS related to the Murray-Darling Basin water management issues, you can reflect on the nature of the environmental, economic and social interactions that have characterised the basin. Could you describe the historical events that led to the issues as described, management responses, and the perceived policy failures? The overall management plan for the MDB uses a thing called Sustainable Diversion Limits (SDL’s) where managers identify what is able to be taken from the river, and in converse, what the river needs to function normally. In any river system, water and flows are needed in rivers to maintain: Physical integrity of the river channel and floodplains (e.g., movement of sediment and maintenance of habitat) Species and biological communities Ecological processes (eg. nutrient, carbon, energy flow) Ecosystem services: Flood attenuation Water purification Fish production When we talk about river flows, from an eco-hydrology point of view, we can categorise them as having specific flow “components”. Extreme low flows - reduced connectivity and limited species migration Low flows / base flows - maintain adequate habitat; drinking water for terrestrial animals; and soil moisture for plants High flow pulses - Support feeding and spawning activities of fish Small floods (2 – 10yr ARI) - enable migration to flood plains, wetlands, and other habitats that act as breeding grounds and provide resources to many species. Drive reproduction processes of riparian plants Large floods (&gt;10yr ARI) – Can change the path of the river, form new habitat, and move sediment and plant matter, connect remote environments When allocating water we try to maintain a “realistic” flow hydrograph based on historical (reference) data. But how do we measure the success or failure? Buying e-water costs a lot of money and is a politically charged issue. So we need to know we are getting it right! Ideally we use a “flow-response” model - a measure of what ecological benefit we will get from a certain flow regime. But this is easier said than done, and measuring benefits is an important area of research. So we need to use indicators – “measures of response”. This can include things like: Vegetation Water Quality (WQ) Biodiversity – e.g., fish / macroinvertebrate trophic index We then monitor/assess indicators and adjust environmental flow management regime … in an ideal world. The Murray-Darling Basin Authority (MDBA) has a program called “FLOW MER” - Measuring Evaluation Research to do just this. = Figure 32: Focus study sites where environmental water delivery is assessed in the MDB.

Conclusions In this exercise, we have explored the complexities of allocating water to the environment in a contested situation (i.e., where there are competing “customers” for the water resource). In particular, in the context of environmental flows we can sumamrise : rivers and associated habitats have intrinsic values appreciate that there is a potential conflict between e-flow vs irrigation allocation water manaagement activity can create stressors on dependent ecosystems e-flow allocation is a river restoration and maintenance tool, to reduce stressors there is a need for identifying “Sustainable Diversion Limits” based on assessment of historical flow requirements the array of benefits from e-water need to quantified and maybe site specific "],["E12.html", "Exercise 12 – Mine dewatering 1. Pump test calculation exercise 2. Mine de-watering application Conclusions", " Exercise 12 – Mine dewatering The aim of this session is to better familiarise ourselves with some common issues associated with groundwater management – including the case of water pump tests and de-watering which is common in the Australian mining industry. Within the lectures we have learnt about groundwater flow and aquifers. And we have previously seen a laboratory scale model of groundwater to understand Darcy flow. In this exercise, we consider how to compute the conditions of an aquifer, based on pump test data, and then we adapt a related approach to describe an open-cut mine de-watering application. 1. Pump test calculation exercise Pump tests are undertaken to test the ability of an aquifer to supply water. When we pump water it causes a cone of depression in the aquifer sutrface, best illustarted in the below diagram: Figure 34: Three dimensional view of water tabel elevation around a well Depending on the rate of response of groundwater levels (\\(h\\)) near the pumping well (at a distance \\(r\\) from the well), one can estimate the transmission properties of the aquifer including the hydraulic conductivity, \\(K\\). The below exercise demonstrates how to calculate this using the Thiem equation. The below diagram shows this relevant information. Figure 35: Schematic of the draw-down cone around an aquifer that is being pumped For an unconfined aquifer, we adapt Darcy’s equation to consider the flow, \\(Q\\), going through the well. For example: \\[\\begin{equation} Q = -KA \\frac{dh}{dr} \\\\ Q = -K (2 \\pi r h) \\frac{dh}{dr} \\tag{13} \\end{equation}\\] whereby, \\(A\\) is the surface area (\\(m^2\\)) of the cylinder over which the flow is occurring, and \\(dh/dr\\) is the slope of the water table towards the well (aka, the hydraulic gradient; \\(m/m\\)). With some assumptions and rearrangement this can be adapted to give the Thiem equation: \\[\\begin{equation} h_0^2 - h^2 = \\frac{Q}{\\pi K} \\: ln \\left[\\frac{R}{r}\\right] \\tag{14} \\end{equation}\\] noting, this is for an unconfined aquifer, with the water table at height \\(h_0\\) before pumping. A slightly different version is used for a confined (artesian) aquifer system, which has a aquifer depth of \\(d\\): \\[\\begin{equation} h-h_0 = \\frac{Q}{2 \\pi T} \\: ln \\left[\\frac{R}{r}\\right] \\tag{15} \\end{equation}\\] where transmissivity, \\(T\\), is defined as aquifer conductivity x depth: \\(T = Kd\\) (in this case \\(d \\sim h_0\\)). Exercise: A hydrologist is undertaking a pump test of an unconfined aquifer. After pumping the aquifer for some time at a constant rate of 100 m3/day, the water level draw-down at a distance of 150m from the pumping well is 1.5m. The total radius of influence of the well is 800m, and the depth of water in the aquifer is estimated to be 10m deep before pumping started. What is the hydraulic conductivity, \\(K\\), of the aquifer material? 2. Mine de-watering application Now we have an idea about how a field based measurement of water table change in response to a fixed pumping rate -this can teach us something about the aquifer conditions. This is useful to do before a site is being actively developed. For example, to help us estimate how much water can be allocated to on-ground operations, and assigning how much can be pumped out in a sustainable way. But another application is the context of mine “de-watering” - this is essentially where water must be extracted to enable below-ground operations to occur. As a first approximation, we can apply the Theim equation assuming the mine-pit is like a “big-well” - see below figure. Figure 36: Schematic of a mining excavation, with a radius, r, and depth of extraction. Exercise: A surface ore deposit in the Pimbara region of MiningLand is scheduled for development. The ore deposit is roughly 1km wide and circular. Miners wish to dig and extract the material down to 25m from the surface, but the water table is sitting at 15m below the land surface and so during the mining activity a de-watering operation is necessary. The mean aquifer depth is estimated to be 50m. For operational reasons, at a distance of 400m from the centre of the operation the water table needs to be reduced below the bottom of the excavation. Environmental regulators have indicated that the dewatering operation may not impact water tables beyond 1500m from the centre of the deposit. Sketch the problem (similar to exercise 1) and annotate with relevant information. As a rough approximation, we can employ the Theim equation to consider the draw-down caused by a groundwater pump, pumping at a steady rate \\(Q\\), for this problem: If we assume a hydraulic conductivity of the region is around 0.5 m/day, and other information as indicated in the question, what is the average rate of discharge, \\(Q\\), that needs to be pumped to pull the groundwater down low enough for mining to occur? Once mining has ceased and de-watering has ceased, the pit is predicted to refill with ground water, but the environmental regulator is placing strict guidelines on the mine operator to ensure the newly formed lake is safe. Outline an environmental monitoring program that you would propose in order to collect necessary data, giving rationale for the chosen measurements. Conclusions In this exercise, we have explored the basics of “pump-tests” and “de-watering” - both routinely undertaken by mining companies to complete mining activities, particularly open-cut mining. You should be able to: conceptualise how water moves towards an actively pumping well. apply the Theim equation to get a simple quantitative estimate of aquifer conductivity. estimate pumping rates required to successfully de-water. recommend monitoring strategies to track the impacts of pumping (before an after) on water quality and water quantiity. "],["L1.html", "Week 2 - Desktop catchments Learning Objectives Building a “Desktop Catchment” What did we learn?", " Week 2 - Desktop catchments Learning Objectives To be able to conceptualise how catchment water stores respond to rainfall. To understand that the relationship between rainfall and runoff depends on soil and catchment conditions. Develop skills related to laboratory data analysis and interpretation. Building a “Desktop Catchment” A real-world catchment is sometimes conceptualised as a “bucket” of soil. This is somehwat simplistic but it does help us clarify a few key concepts that underpin our understanding of the water balance. Using this analogy, the soil acts like a “sponge” that can store water. Improtantly, a certain amount of water needs to be stored in the sponge before it will release any. Think about your kitchen sponge - it will soak up water to a point, after which it becomes saturated and cannot hold more - any excess added will simply leak away. The catchment geomorphology and soil also means that the bucket needs to have a certain amount of water stored before it will leak any to the river network. We call this a storage threshold. This threshold amount of water storage needs to be met before any discharge will occur. In a pure bucket of soil, the soil capilliarity will hold onto water. In soil science, the amount of water that soil can hold before the water starts to flow (e.g. drain away) is called the field capacity. If rain falls on a catchment at a time when the storgae threshold is already met (i.e., the bucket is already partially full), then even a small amount of rain can cause a discharge to occur. However, if a rainfall event occurs when the bucket is near to empty, then the rainfall will first be soaked up and not lead to any discharge unless the storage threshold is met. The starting conditions at the begining of an event are called the antededent conditions. Figure 37: A catchment can be conceptualised as a bucket of soil, which holds and releases water. In this laboratory we will create a desktop catchment able to simulate this behaviour. By comparing data collected using different “bucket” settings, we can assess the importance of soil properties and antecedent conditions on the relationship between discharge and rainfall. Step 1 : Catchment Setup In the lab you will be introdcued to the desktop cacthment setup. Start by filling the catchment with soil. Estimate the volume of soil that was added - start by making a regualr shape to compute the volume and then shape the catchment to be more realistic. Figure 38: Photo of the desktop catchment. Across the class we will compare different settings, comparing a) catchment slope and b) antecedent conditions (in the form of different soil moisture amounts). Depending on your allocated settings, prepare your cacthment. Adjust slope with blocks provided. Add an initial amount of moisture using the watering can as guided. We are now ready to start the experiment, but first we must characterise how much water is stored in the soil. Step 2 : Characterising soil moisture Soil water terms During this exercise you will measure some of the key properties for soil hydrology. To do this, you will collect soil from locations of your choosing to analyse. You will then calculate soil moisture content, porosity and field capacity. Let’s start by remembering some key terms: Porosity: The porosity is the ratio of the volume of the voids to the total volume of the sample. So if you have a sample of 100 cm3 and 30 cm3 is void space (non-solid), then you have a porosity of 0.3 or 30%. Total Moisture Content: is measured by calculating mass loss during oven drying of wet samples at 103-105˚C for 1-2hrs. You can also measure the air-dried moisture content (measured as loss of mass during air-drying at a temperature of around 40˚C. Saturated Water Content: Where all pore space in the soil is occupied by water and no further absorption of rainfall is possible. This will be equal to the total porosity. Field capacity: The water content remaining after water has drained out of the soil under gravity. Technically, this is the moisture content remaining in soil subjected to -0.033MPa (0.3Bar) pressure (i.e. slight vacuum) because capillary action, osmotic pressure and gravity are balanced at this point. In the landscape, the excess water has moved downwared through the soil to become groundwater recharge. Wilting Point: Plant roots can’t extract any more water (i.e. apply a suction stronger than -1.5 MPa) from this soil and begin to die. Permanent wilting point is the moisture content remaining in soil subjected to -1.50MPa (15 Bar) pressure (i.e. moderate vacuum). Available Water Content: This is the amountof moisture available for plants to extract, and is caluclated from Field Capacity – Permanent Wilting Point. This water does not drain through to the watertable under gravity, and also is not held too tightly by the soil, so that plants are able access it for uptake through their roots. Sample Collection First, start by collecting your soil samples. If your in the lab, this will be from our setup. If your stuck at home, you can do this in your kitchen as an exercise! Clear the surface and use a small “core” (e.g. measuring cup or inverted can) to collect your samples. Collect two replicate samples. You will probably want to wrap these in foil to keep them from falling apart and then place them in a zip-lock bag (sealed tight to stop the sample drying out) with the sample ID recorded in permanent marker ready for transport back to “the lab” (i.e. your kitchen). While you are in the field make sure you record the coordinates (or location) where you collected the samples. You should also make a brief description of the soil - what colour is it (in real scientific studies we use colour charts to make sure colour descriptions are robust and repeatable). Would you describe your soil sample as sand? Or is it silty, making it feel with finer grains because of the finer grains. Sometimes it’s difficult to tell just by touch whether a sample contains silt or clay because these are both fine-grained. To test for clay you can roll a sample in your palm, if it holds a cylindrical sausage shape then it contains clay. Does your sample seem to have a lot of dark brown organic matter, or not much? For each sample use a balance to record the sample weight, making sure you correctly blank the balance to account for the sample container weight. Record the dimensions and volume of your samples. Then place them onto a tray that is suitable for going into the oven. Then place the tray into the oven for drying at ~105˚C. Leave in the oven until the sample is totally dry and then re-weigh (check after for 1-2 hours; in the meantime goto Step 3). Now you can use your measured data to compute the soil moisture and porosity of each sample following the instructions below. Repeat for the replicates of each soil and enter your sample details and your results into the online Google sheet. Make sure to enter your data on the correct sheet for this teaching period. Figure 39: A soil sample (core) collected using a kitchen measuring cup. Computing Soil Moisture and Soil Porosity Soil moisture (water content) and porosity (proportion of void space) are key parameters that describe the capacity of soils to store water. Let’s calculate these parameters for each the the soil samples you collected. Soil moisture: For each of your soils samples you should have measured the soil weight before and after drying in the oven. The mass-loss during oven drying represents the weight of water contained in that soil volume. (Note that clayey soils can retain considerable amounts of water when they are air-dry). Based on this water mass we can work out the gravimetric (by weight) and/or volumetric (by volume) water content of each soil sample. The volumetric water content (VWC, \\(\\theta\\), theta, unitless because it is a ratio), is calculated from the mass of wet and oven dried samples and taking into account the total sample volume using Equation (16). You can express this value as a % by multiplying your result from (16) by 100. Enter your results into the online table (via Google Sheets) \\[\\begin{equation} \\theta=\\frac{V_w}{V_T}=\\frac{\\left(M_{\\text{sample}}-M_{\\text{dry}}\\right)}{V_T\\ \\rho_w} \\tag{16} \\end{equation}\\] Soil Porosity: Let’s now calculate the bulk density of the soil, and therefore the porosity of the soil. Bulk density \\(\\rho_b\\) is the mass of dry soil per unit volume. You have already measured the dry volume of your soil, so to determine the bulk density you just need to work out the volume of your soil sample (if it was a column of core then volume = \\(\\pi r^2 h\\) where \\(r\\) is radius and \\(h\\) is height of soil in the sample). From the bulk density and particle density \\(\\rho_p\\) (2.65 g cm-3) you can then calculate the porosity \\(\\phi=\\ \\left(1-\\frac{\\rho_b}{\\rho_p}\\right)\\). This value will also be a ratio, and you can multiply it by 100 to calculate the porosity as a %. Now that you know the porosity, you can estimate the water storage potential, \\(S_{\\text{max}}\\) of your sample by multiplying the soil volume by the porosity as shown in Equation (17). Add your results of these analyses to the online Google Sheet. \\[\\begin{equation} S_{max}=\\ \\phi{\\ V}_{soil} \\tag{17} \\end{equation}\\] Step 3 : Collect experimental data Once you have prepared the experimental setup, and taken the soil samples to the oven, you are now ready to go. Start the logger on the computer, and then start the rainfall (i.e., turn the tap on). The rain should occur for around 10-15 minutes, or at least long enough for the catchment flow to be occuring. After you turn off the rainfall tap, keep the system logging, and wait for the soil to keeping draining. After 10 or so minutes stop the logger and export the data as a csv or xls file. Step 4 : Data analysis The experimental data saved from the data-logger can be used to visualise the change in rainfall and runoff (discharge) over time, and used to calculate the total rainfall and runoff amount. Plotting the experimental data In Excel, plot a time-series graph showing rainfall and the cumulative volume of discharge. We can compute the discharge rate by looking at the difference between the output volume between two time-steps. Make sure the units are described correctly - the units of rainfall or L/min and the units in the “tank” are L. Once you are happy with your clean data set you can use the logged data to identify the properties of the storm event, including: Time from rainfall onset to when runoff began to be recorded (mins), Time to peak discharge (mins), Total rainfall volume (cm3), Total runoff volume (cm3), Average rainfall intensity (cm/min), The runoff coefficient, \\(c\\), for the ‘storm’ event. Estimate the lag time Once you have plotted the rainfall and discharge, estimate the start time of the rain event, and the start time of the discharge. The time difference is the lag time that it took to fill the storage threshold - the amount the soil needed to be wetted prior to discharge occuring. Computing the runoff coefficient The runoff coefficient is the ratio of discharge to the input rainfall amount. Simply calculate this total discharge volume / total rainfall volume. Share and compare your results Once the above steps are completed, log onto the shared data spreadsheet [here] and enter your results. Use the shared data to compare the parameters computed for different cacthment settings. Explore the data, for example, make a scatter plot comparing discharge and rainfall. How does runoff coefficient compare to antecedant conditions. What about catchment slope? What did we learn? Spatial heterogeneity is a substantial issue in subsurface hydrology. What is the variation between sample replicates? How does this compare to the mean of the measured values (i.e. is the variation large relative to the mean?). How much do the soil parameter estimates vary across the whole data set? How did the volumetric water content in your soil compare to your estimate of the total porosity? Was the soil close to saturated, or very dry? Does this make sense in terms of where and when you collected it (time since rainfall, proximity to surface water or drainage). Based on your measured Smax, what would be the water storing capacity in the upper 2 m of soil over an area of 1 km2 ? Does this seem like a lot of water, or not much? How does your estimate of field capacity compare to your estimate of the total porosity? Does this seem reasonable? What does this mean for plant water availability? What are the sources of error in your parameter estimates? What could you improve if you had to do this again? What haven’t we measured that would also be useful to know about soils if we want to understand runoff and streamflow generation mechanisms? "],["L2.html", "Lab 2 - Streamflow analysis Making Sense of Streamflow Data Measuring Stream Velocity &amp; Discharge", " Lab 2 - Streamflow analysis In this module we understand how to generate streamflow data, and how to use it charcaterise variability in stream discharge rates. Making Sense of Streamflow Data The first step in any hydrologic data analysis project is to gather the data and relevant background information on your catchment of interest. In Western Australia the WIR website contains all of the data and information you need, and we will use this in our future assignments. All states/countries have something similar; the USA has one of the best examples through the USGS NWIS website. If you click the site information button, enter your gauge name or number, and browse the available datasets for your river. For this analysis, you will need daily discharge data, peak streamflow, and the annual water data report. Other datasets may also be helpful for understanding the hydrologic behavior of your river. Hydrologic analyses are almost always conducted for “water years” not calendar years. In the Northern Hemisphere. A water year begins on October 1 and ends September 30 . In the Southern Hemisphere it Starts May 1 and ends April 30, though this can be region specific. Daily Unit Discharge Hydrograph Figure 40: The Avon River, Western Australia Unit discharge is the total discharge of the river divided by the watershed area. Thus, it has units of m3/s/km2. Unit discharge is very useful for comparing the hydrologic behaviour of catchments of different size (since discharge scales with area). Depending on your data source you will need to download data and do appropriate conversions in a spreadsheet. A properly formatted unit discharge hydrograph has a descriptive title, labelled axes, and a logarithmic y-axis. If you need help with formatting the graph in Excel, please don’t hesitate to ask for help! Activity: Get the Swan River “Walyunga” gauge data (616011) from the download button (or alternatively goto the WIR web link, and download the continuous flow data for the site directly from the database). Figure 41: Navigate to the ‘Walyunga’ guage (616011) In Excel, explore the data; note the different columns are the same discharge data in different units. Create a hydrograph comparing discharge between a wet year and a dry year. Use the column which is “total” in units of ML/day. For the plot, compare the two years on a common x-axis by aligning the two years side-by-side and plotting as two series. On the x-axis, use a “hydrologic year” rather than calendar years, which spans from 1 Apr to 31 Mar. Label accordingly. This is the flow leaving the catchment area. Now repeat the exercise but this time by creating a unit hydrograph - for this you will need to divide by the catchment area; refer to the above information and check units are consistent. This gauge is draining the Avon catchment which has an area 125,000 km^2. Flow Duration Curves What is it? The flow duration curve is a plot that shows the percentage of time that flow in a stream is likely to equal or exceed some specified value of interest. For example, it can be used to show the percentage of time river flow can be expected to exceed a design flow of some specified value (e.g., 20 m3/s), or to show the discharge of the stream that occurs or is exceeded some percent of the time (e.g., 80% of the time). How is it calculated? The basic time unit used in preparing a flow-duration curve will greatly affect its appearance. For most studies, mean daily discharges are used. These will give a steep curve. When the mean flow over a long period is used (such as mean monthly flow), the resulting curve will be flatter due to averaging of short-term peaks with intervening smaller flows during a month. Extreme values are averaged out more and more, as the time period gets larger (e.g., for a flow duration curve based on annual flows at a long-record station). Step 1: Sort (rank) average daily discharges for period of record from the largest value to the smallest value, involving a total of \\(n\\) values. (\\(n\\) is the sample size). Step 2: Assign each discharge value a rank (\\(M\\)), starting with 1 for the largest daily discharge value. Step 3: Calculate exceedence probability (\\(P\\)) as follows: \\[\\begin{equation} P = 100 * [\\frac{M}{n+1}] \\tag{18} \\end{equation}\\] where, \\(P\\) = the probability that a given flow will be equaled or exceeded (% of time), \\(M\\) = the ranked position on the listing (dimensionless), and \\(n\\) = the number of events for period of record (dimensionless). Activity: Follow the above steps using the 616011 gauge data to create your own flow duration curve. What does this particular information tell you about your stream? A flow duration curve characterizes the ability of the basin to provide flows of various magnitudes. Information concerning the relative amount of time that flows past a site are likely to equal or exceed a specified value of interest is extremely useful for the design of structures on a stream. For example, a structure can be designed to perform well within some range of flows, such as flows that occur between 20 and 80% of the time (or some other selected interval). The shape of a flow-duration curve in its upper and lower regions is particularly significant in evaluating the stream and basin characteristics. The shape of the curve in the high-flow region indicates the type of flood regime the basin is likely to have, whereas, the shape of the low-flow region characterizes the ability of the basin to sustain low flows during dry seasons. A very steep curve (high flows for short periods) would be expected for rain-caused floods on small watersheds. Snowmelt floods, which last for several days, or regulation of floods with reservoir storage, will generally result in a much flatter curve near the upper limit. In the low-flow region, an intermittent stream would exhibit periods of no flow, whereas, a very flat curve indicates that moderate flows are sustained throughout the year due to natural or artificial streamflow regulation, or due to a large groundwater capacity which sustains the base flow to the stream. An example, properly formatted flow duration curve is shown below (Figure 42). Figure 42: Aproperly formatted flow duration curve Flood Frequency Analysis What is it? Flood frequency analyses are used to predict design floods for sites along a river. The technique involves using observed annual peak flow discharge data to calculate statistical information such as mean values, standard deviations, skewness, and recurrence intervals. These statistical data are then used to construct frequency distributions, which are graphs and tables that tell the likelihood of various discharges as a function of recurrence interval or exceedence probability. Flood frequency distributions can take on many forms according to the equations used to carry out the statistical analyses. Four of the common forms are: Normal Distribution; Log-Normal Distribution; Gumbel Distribution; and Log-Pearson Type III Distribution. Each distribution can be used to predict design floods; however, there are advantages and disadvantages of each technique. While the log Pearson Type III distribution is the recommended technique, its application is a bit more complex than we are going to undertake for this class. Instead, we will use the older Weibull plotting position method. Flood frequency information can be determined from knowledge of the peak discharge (highest discharge) in any given year provided enough years of information has been collected. This allows one to relate the expected recurrence interval for a given discharge, and determine the probability that a flood of a given discharge will occur in any given year. The recurrence interval for a given discharge can be calculated by first ranking the discharges. Activity: In the Table below for “Big River”, fill in the Rank column. To do this, enter a 1 for the maximum discharge that has occurred during the 20 years of available data. The second highest discharge will be given a rank of 2, etc. with the lowest discharge given a value of 20. Table 8: Complete the table for ‘Big River’ Date Maximum Discharge (m3/s), \\(Q\\) Rank, \\(m\\) Recurrence Interval, \\(R\\) 28-Feb-86 1410 4-Mar-87 2890 22-Mar-88 1850 3-Mar-89 800 1-Feb-90 1000 12-Apr-91 692 4-Apr-92 1350 2-May-93 1200 16-Mar-94 850 6-Jul-95 2400 21-Feb-96 890 30-Jan-97 1480 16-Mar-98 1500 21-Feb-99 1300 12-May-00 1700 8-Apr-01 2200 1-Mar-02 1830 8-Feb-03 1120 12-Mar-04 750 6-Mar-05 1250 After you have filled in the Rank column, you can now calculate the recurrence interval for each peak discharge. The recurrence interval, \\(R\\), is given by the Weibull Equation: \\[\\begin{equation} R = \\frac{n+1}{m} \\tag{19} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(n\\) is the number of years over which the data was collected (20 years in this case), and \\(m\\) is the rank of each peak discharge. Use this equation to calculate the recurrence interval for each peak discharge. Next, use the graph below (or Excel) to plot a graph of discharge (on the y-axis) versus recurrence interval (on the x-axis). Note that the x-axis must be a logarithmic scale. If drawig by hand you should try to estimate as best you can where the data point will fall between the lines on the graph. Once you have plotted the points use a ruler to draw the best fit straight line through the data points (lay a ruler on the graph and try to draw a line that most closely approximates all of the data points). Do not draw lines that connect individual data points. If you are plotting in Excel you will fit a linear trendline. By extrapolating your line on the graph, determine the peak discharge expected in a flood with a recurrence interval of 50 years and 100 years. These are the discharges expected in a 50 year flood and a 100 year flood. The annual exceedence probability, \\(P_{e}\\), is the probability that a given discharge will occur in a given year. It is calculated as the inverse of the recurrence interval, \\(R\\): \\[\\begin{equation} P_{e} = \\frac{1}{R} \\tag{20} \\end{equation}\\] Thus, the probability that a flood with a 10 year recurrence interval will occur in any year is 1/10 = 0.1 or 10%. What are the probabilities that a 50 year flood and a 100 year flood will occur in any given year? Extra activity: Repeat the above flood frequency analysis using the 616011 Walyunga data set that you downloaded in Excel (Hint, use a pivot table and the max option to get the annual maximum discharge). Measuring Stream Velocity &amp; Discharge The process of measuring stream flow (volume rate of flow), or discharge, is called stream gauging. There are numerous methods of stream gauging, including direct methods, such as volumetric gauging, and dilution methods, as well as indirect methods involving stage-discharge relations, or rating curves. Since the velocity of a stream varies with depth and width across a stream, it is important to understand what it is you want to measure when choosing a stream gauging method. If you are interested in stream surface velocity, a simple float method would work well. This method involves throwing some buoyant, highly visible object into the stream and measuring the time it takes to float a known distance. If you are interested in obtaining a more accurate stream discharge measurement, the velocity-area method is your method of choice. Stream flow (discharge) can be measured based on two fundamental methods, which are each expanded upon below (refer to lecture 3 for details). The first requires a direct measurement of velocity, whereas the second is an approximation based on stream-bed slope and geometry. Flow Rate: Velocity-Area Method Flow estimates in natural streams and artificial channels under steady (no change in depth with time) and uniform (no change in depth with space) conditions can be computed by the product of mean flow velocity (integrated in depth and across the channel) and the cross-sectional area of flow. The equation \\(Q = V * A\\), were \\(V\\) (m/s) is the mean velocity and \\(A\\) (m2) is the flow (or water) cross-sectional area is used for this purpose. Large streams and rivers, a section control is needed to generate the “rating curve” thus establishing a relationship between water stage height (\\(H\\)) and flow discharge (\\(Q\\)). In this case, both flow velocity measurements and cross-sectional areas are needed. Discharge using the Velocity-Area method is measured by integrating the area and velocity of each point across the stream. The channel or stream is divided into sections based on where the velocity and stage height measurements were taken in the cross-section of the stream/channel. The flow velocity is measured using a current meter (i.e. propeller, electromagnetic, ultrasonic, and Doppler). The discharge is computed using: \\[\\begin{equation} Q = \\sum^{n}_{i=0} (V_{i} * \\text{Area}_{i}) \\tag{21} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(n\\) is the number of vertical for measuring velocities, \\(V_{i}\\) is the mean velocity value for vertical \\(i\\) (m/s) and \\(\\text{Area}_i\\) is the cross-sectional area around vertical \\(i\\) (m2). The cross-sectional area is best estimated by treating the sections as rectangles, trapezia or triangles. Figure 43: Current-meter discharge measurements are made by determining the discharge in each subsection of a channel cross section and summing the subsection discharges to obtain a total discharge. To measure stream velocity we can utilise a “swoffer” – a pole with a propeller on the end with an electronic logger recording the rotations. A current meter is so designed that its rotation speed varies linearly with the stream velocity at the location of the instrument. A more modern alternative is an “ADV” (Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter). This relies on a method where it looks at the scatter of sound waves rebounding of particles/bubbles in the water, and based on the “Doppler effect” (recall the sound of a train changing pitch as it moves past you), it can compute the water velocity. Figure 44: An ADV - used to measure stream velocity. Activity: Watch the videos below showing the principles of how to measure the velocity of water. Then calculate the streamflow at the two sites in Table. The “section” column tells you nominally where you are across the x-section, the “width” column is the actual width of flow you should use in your calculations. Each velocity and depth measurement was made at the distance across the stream reported in the “distance” column. Does the wider stream section have more streamflow? Is this what you would have expected? Site 1 is upstream of Site 2, did the flow increase or decrease downstream? What might have caused this change in flow?

In practice, when you are in the field the bottom slope (\\(S\\)) will be measured by using a differential GPS (DGPS). You also need to measure the ‘wetted perimeter’ (\\(P\\)) of the channel and the cross sectional area (\\(A\\)). The roughness coefficient (\\(n\\)) should be assumed from the literature, based on your observations or the stream and a table like the one below, or here, or here, or here. Activity: For this activity we will use some of the same measured data that we used for the velocity-area method. Those measurements were taken on Carey Brook, a tributary to the Donnelly River in south-west Western Australia (near Pemberton). You have already calculated the total area (sum the individual areas calculated in the velocity-area method). Draw a scale diagram of your chosen cross-section to estimate the wetted perimeter. Use the slope over the 5.2 km of Carey Bk between the main highway (25 m AHD) and where it flows into the Donnelly River (7 m AHD). Now you just need a roughness parameter, Manning’s \\(n\\), and you can solve Equation (22). How does this streamflow estimate compare to the answer you got using the velocity-area method above? How sensitive is your answer to the value of Manning’s \\(n\\)? "],["L3_1.html", "Week 4 - Groundwater and surface water interaction", " Week 4 - Groundwater and surface water interaction Learning Objectives In this experiment, you will use data from a physical model of a catchment during a simulated rainfall event to demonstrate the relative contributions of pre-event (‘old’) and event (‘new’) water to the observed streamflow. The real-world setting for the experiment is a gaining stream (Figure 45). At the conclusion of this exercise students will have demonstrated an ability to: analyse measured experimental data to characterize the key properties of a rainfall event. differentiate the quantity of pre-event and event components of water in a storm hydrograph (hydrochemical baseflow separation). discuss the significance of experimental results for managing water resources in the context of surface water - groundwater interaction. Background A question we often want to be able to answer is how much groundwater is contributing to flow in a river, and how much of the water we see came from recent rainfall. This is relevant for water resources planning so we can work out the discharge rate of an aquifer, or for water quality management. Figure 45: Groundwater discharge to a gaining stream. Groundwater usually has different chemical characteristics to storm runoff during a rainfall event and we can use this chemical signal as a tracer for groundwater contribution. In this experiment you will demonstrate how groundwater (pre-event or ‘old’ water) contribution to river flow changes over the course of a storm event, relative to water that fell as rain during the storm event (event or ‘new’ water). You will use the tracer dilution technique with salinity (measured as electrical conductivity, \\(EC\\)) as the groundwater tracer. Figure 46: Schematic of interactions and different water sources being explored in this lab activity. Note that in this case the rain has 0ppt salinity and the groundwater has 10ppt salinity. What is the salinity in the outflowing water going to be? Experimental Method Set up of apparatus The experimental set-up consists of a tray of soil, the ability to add rainfall at a controlled rate (via a connection to the tap), and discharge outlets at the bottom of the catchment. During the experiment loggers are set up to measure the rainfall flow amount as well as the streamflow volume and EC of the catchment outlet water over time (Figure 47). The loggers for rainfall, streamflow and EC that are connected to a computer. Figure 47: Experimental setup showing the catchment tray, rainfall, sprinklers and logger location. Create the aquifer The first step is to create the “aquifer” by loading the bottom of the tray with river sand. The top surface is set to be smoothed so that it has an even thickness laterally across the catchment, and shaped like a wedge, so then the volume of this layer can be estimated. Importantly, the top of aquifer sits below the top line of outlets as shown in Figure 48. At this step compute the volume of soil added in the aquifer layer, and note it down. To create the aquifer (pre-event) groundwater, the sand should be saturated with saline water (making sure to note the initial EC of the starting saline solution; it should be about 10ppt). Note the volume of water added to fill the aquifer. Remove any excess ponded water removed with a syringe before proceeding. Figure 48: Saturated aquifer correctly set up within catchment model. Create the unsaturated zone This saturated aquifer layer is then overlain with a second layer of dry soil, being careful not to disturb the original aquifer layer. This upper layer can be shaped into the form of a catchment (e.g., concave) so that when the subsurface fills up there is a stream flowing towards the catchment outlet (Figure 49). The middle outlet should not be covered with soil, but the soil should be just below this outlet (this is your riverbed). At this step you could see some capillary rise of aquifer water into the vadose zone (upper soil layer). Figure 49: Unsaturated zone on to of aquifer. Topography should slope towards the middle and the catchment outlet. Make it rain The rainfall outlets should then be brought close to the catchment surface, to avoid “raining” outside the catchment, and then the tubes at the bottom of the catchment checked to ensure they are not blocked and directed into the PVC drain where the outflow is measured. Start the logger logging. And now the rain! The apparatus should then be left with the rain on for approximately 15-20 minutes until the catchment has filled up, streamflow has begun and the EC at the catchment outlet has clearly decreased (Figure 50). To finish, turn the rain off but leave the loggers still running for another 15-20 minutes, or until streamflow ceased, so you can measure what happens after the rain has stopped. Once all is done save the logger data as a *.csv file and share with your team. Figure 50: Streamflow at the catchment outlet. Measure the final soil EC To find out how much of the initial salinity is left after the storm, after the rain has ceased, take two samples from the catchment for soil EC analysis - one from the aquifer near to the upper and lower areas. Follow the provided handout for instructions on measuring soil EC. Figure 51: Look for the instruction sheet on how to measure soil EC Data Analysis QA-QC of data Use the data collected from the data logger (saved as csv). If it is not available then download the reference/default data sheet provided on LMS. Before you can start your analysis you might need to clean the data – remove any outliers and identify where your experimental data start and stop. You have very high temporal resolution data (1Hz = 1 entry per second!), which combines with the sensitivity of your loggers to give you a lot of noise. You can smooth the data by calculating a running average (over 30 seconds or more) to get smooth temporal trends. Refer to analysis done in Lab 1 also. Characterizing the rainfall event Once you are happy with your clean data set you can use the logged data to identify the properties of the storm event, including: Time from rainfall onset to when runoff began to be recorded (mins), Time to peak discharge (mins), Total rainfall volume (cm3 or L), Total runoff volume (cm3 or L), Average rainfall intensity (L/min), The runoff coefficient, \\(c\\), for the ‘storm’ event (fraction of rain that left as streamflow). Separating pre-event and event water Now let’s calculate the contributions of pre-event (baseflow = groundwater) and event (rainfall and new runoff) water. Because the groundwater was saline you can use the tracer dilution method (see the blue box below for details) to calculate the fraction of the hydrograph that is from baseflow. In other words, we want to calculate and plot a hydrograph showing each of the components of the water balance: \\(Q_{\\text{out}}(t) = Q_{\\text{event}} + Q_{\\text{pre-event}}\\) where \\(Q_{\\text{out}}\\) (cm3/s) is the volumetric flow rate measured at the outlet of the catchment, \\(Q_{\\text{event}}\\) (cm3/s) is the volumetric flow rate of event water (representing rainfall and runoff) and \\(Q_{\\text{pre-event}}\\) is the volumetric flow rate of pre-event water (representing groundwater). If there is a difference in the salinity of groundwater and rainfall-runoff then we can estimate the groundwater contribution to the streamflow by looking at changes in salinity at the catchment outlet (measured as electrical conductivity, or EC). To do this we assume that the EC in groundwater is at a pre-event reference level, \\(S_{\\text{pre-event}}\\), and EC in the rain \\(S_{\\text{event}}\\) is effectively 0. The level of dilution in EC in streamflow can then be used to estimate the fraction of pre-event (groundwater baseflow) and event (rainfall-runoff) water contributing to total streamflow. The salt mass balance tells us that the total salt mass coming out of the catchment via the stream must equal the sum of pre-event and event components: \\(S_{\\text{out}} * Q_{\\text{out}} = S_{\\text{event}} * Q_{\\text{event}} + S_{\\text{pre-event}} * Q_{\\text{pre-event}}\\) And because the rainfall and runoff didn’t have any salt added, \\(S_{\\text{event}} = 0\\) So that we can cancel the “event” term and rearrange to solve for the pre-event component of volumetric flow: \\(Q_{\\text{pre-event}} = S_{\\text{out}}*Q_{\\text{out}} / S_{\\text{pre-event}}\\) And once this pre-event component is known, we can calculate the event component of volumetric flow from rearranging the water balance to give: \\(Q_{\\text{event}} = Q_{\\text{out}} - Q_{\\text{pre-event}}\\) Interpretation and conclusions Create a summary plot that nicely shows the runoff and indicates the fraction leaving the catchment that is “baseflow” (i.e. aquifer water). How do the relative amounts of pre-event and event water change over time? Is the change in \\(Q_{\\text{pre-event}}/Q_{\\text{event}}\\) over time what you would expect? How could attributes of the experimental setup have increased or decreased the baseflow contribution? How would the results have changed if we ran the experiment again, starting with a wetted-up unsaturated zone? How realistic is the experiment in terms of capturing the interaction of surface water and groundwater? What are the significance of these results for water resource management? "],["F1_1.html", "Week 5 - Helena River Sampling Activities", " Week 5 - Helena River Sampling Activities On arrival Arrive at the carpark near King’s Meadow Oval. Firstly check-in with an instructor and get your bearings. You will take a pack with you, and other equipment you will see at the stations. During your site visit you will be instructed to follow the tasks below and record your data in handout. If in doubt, please ask for assistance. You will undertake 4 main activities (Tasks A to D). Task A – Surface Water Flows and Salinity Explore the site, considering the surface water pathways. Bear in mind there is an estuary a river a lake and some stormwater drainage in your vicinity! Use the LIDAT map provided and consider the relief. Be able to identify flow direction in the main waterways bounding the site (Swan River to the west and Helena River to the south-east). Be able to identify water accumulation areas within the site itself. Consider the horizontal and vertical movement pathways of this water. Identify Eucalyptus rudis trees and their health in context of the landscape. Measure at two contrasting locations the surface water salinity, and note details the data sheet. Include the GPS locations. Take one from each of your allocated regions. You can Take them from Helena or Swan river, or any internal site. We will collate data from students to make a class data summary. Use waders provided for deeper waters – use a stick/ruler to judge depth of water before taking steps and do not enter into fast-running water above knee height. Figure 52: Example inundation pattern. Which way is the water flowing? Task B – Helena River Flow Navigate to the Helena River, where it flows under the Bridge. Say hi to Kirsty, and tell her your favorite song at the moment. Undertake a stream gauging measurement to determine the river flow. Refer to Lab 2 - Streamflow analysis … here we will undertake the “Velocity-Area method”. You’ll need to jot down the stream cross-sectinoal profile and velocity measurements. Task C – Groundwater sampling Visit the two allocated existing piezometer wells (refer to map below, consult instructor for locations if you cant find them). Note the Well Identification Number. e.g. HW-1, HW-2 etc. Record results from the following tasks: Record the depth from the Top of the Casing (TOC) to the ground level. Record the depth from the water to the top of the casing. Use the “dipper” provided. “Bail the well” with the bailer, and take a sample of the water for salinity determination (measure EC of the groundwater). Consider the hydraulic slope – how do you think the height of the water table varies along the transect. Try sketching a cross-section along the transect, and consider how you would apply Darcy’s Law. Task D – Soil salinity In this task we want to expand our data beyond the transect of bores more widely. What is the thickness of the unsaturated zone where these trees can root into? Goto the bridge location and look for Chris. Once you give him the secret handshake (in a covid-safe way), he will give you some gear. Identify a soil/groundwater sampling location away from the piezometer transect, in your given region (Chris will sort you out). Take an exact GPS reading to log your site. Split the tasks below between your team mates: Measure the soil salinity of a sample at the surface, and 20 cm below the surface. Note soil salinity measurement is different from the water salinity measurement. Use the hand auger, drill to reach the water table (~ 50cm) below the surface (this may vary depending on the exact site chosen). Carefully extract the soil, without the hole collapsing. Once settled (~5-10mins), take an EC reading of the water pooling in the bottom, and note the water level below the ground surface. Take caution the depth is accurate relative to the pre-disturbed surface.

The data set that you will work on is part of a long-term research investigation being undertaken with the WA Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions (DBCA) and UWA. The goal of this research is to understand the drivers of decline of E. rudis in relation to the changing hydrology regime at the Guildford floodplains along the Helena river. At the completion of this assessment students will have demonstrated their ability to: analyse and interpret measured hydrological data develop a conceptual hydrological model effectively communicate their understanding of a hydrological system through a written report Background The degradation of freshwater systems by increasing salinity is a major challenge facing Western Australia. Salinisation of the Avon river, which enters the Upper Swan river at Walyunga National Park, arose due to poor land-management leading to secondary salinity in the inland wheatbelt catchments. Whilst secondary salinity is not an issue in the Swan Coastal Plain where our study site is, the salt loads from the Avon in addition to rising sea levels and decreasing rainfall trend have been driving changes in the seasonal movement of marine waters, with increasing penetration of the salt wedge further inland from the ocean (Huang et al. 2018). The City of Swan has identified our focus site on the Helena River near Guildford as an area of concern due to the decline of Eucalyptus rudis. E. rudis plays a vital role in the riparian ecosystem. Riparian woodland species are important filters that reduce nutrient transfers from the land into the river, which is a significant issue in the Swan river and its tributaries (excessive nutrients have historically resulted in noxious algal blooms). There is therefore a need to better understand what drives decline and if projected drying conditions for the region will make the pressures worse. Salinisation of river systems can cause shifts in floodplain vegetation which arise because of river water interaction with the floodplain. Depending on the salinity increase and the salt tolerance of the floodplain tree species, this can cause shifts in community structure. Eucalyptus rudis is important species that has a natural range along the Swan river and its tributaries. This species has been reported to be in decline for over 15 years along the Swan river (Clay &amp; Majer 2001), and more recently along one of the tributaries of the Swan river: the Guildford floodplains of the Helena river (Dundas 2011). It is currently unknown the exact role of water availability and salinity in the observed decline, and alternate hypothesis related to tree pathogens (e.g. Phytophthora) are also as drivers of decline are also under investigation. Helena River Study Site Start by watching this video recorded by Matt Hipsey to give you an introduction to the Helena River site. You can see the key features of the site marked on this aerial photo. The natural surface drainage of the site has been altered by artificial surface drainage channels. A series of monitoring wells have previously been installed at the site. The following LIDAR image shows the surface topography, with the locations of groundwater wells also indicated. Figure 53: High-resolution LIDAR image of the surface topography of the Helena River study site in Guildford. The red-circles indicate groundwater observation wells. These groundwater monitoring wells are holes that have been drilled into the ground and lined with PVC pipes that has slots at the bottom to let the water in. All you can see from the land surface is the top of the PVC casing sticking up with a cap and sometimes a lock on it. If you want to use these wells for a scientific purpose you need to know the construction details. Firstly, where is the well (GPS coordinates) and what are the dimensions (depth and diameter) of the well? The well dimensions will determine the equipment you need to sample it. Secondly, across what depth range (and more importantly, elevation) is the screen interval (the area where slots are present)? This is the actual elevation of your groundwatre pressure measurement; it’s important that you know this so that you can compare your measurement with existing data. Once you get to a well, the first thing to do is measure the depth to water - from this measurement you can work out the elevation of the watertable, and also how much water is sitting in the well (standing water). If you want to sample for salinity or hydrochemical properties, then as a rule of thumb you need to remove 3-times this volume of standing water from the well before you take the sample to ensure the sample is representative of the aquifer. Your task During this assessment you will use existing data to delineate the hydrologic pathways (surface and sub-surface) that determine the distribution of water and salt in this floodplain system. You will use this information to develop a hydrological conceptual model of this site. Your assessment report should describe the context of the investigation and summarise your findings and observations as suitable for a reader such as the City of Swan Environmental Management team. After your analysis you should be able to: Identify the distressed and dead trees at the site Identify the surface water flow regime - where and when does surface water pond or flow Articulate the key features of the groundwater system - water level trends, groundwater flow directions, and surface water - groundwater interaction areas Assess the distribution of salinity in groundwater wells (piezometers) and surface water Conceptualise the hydrologic processes influencing salt movement and accumulation across the site Articulate possible links between this conceptualization and declining health of E. Rudis The data you need for the assessment is in the file Helena Data Combined.xlsx 1. Literature review Start by reading this report by UWA researchers to learn more about the history of scientific studies at this site and recent findings: 2. Mapping vegetation change There are now a range of spatial data products that have been generated from aerial imagery and remote sensing methods that we can use to help understand hydrological processes. One of these products is Nearmap, which allows us to access aerial imagery to investigate the changes in vegetation (and surface water distribution) over time. Nearmap can be accessed at: http://maps.au.nearmap.com (login via UWA library Onesearch - see this webpage for details). Once you have successfully logged into Nearmap you can find the study site by searching for Guildford and then identifying the confluence of the Helena and Swan Rivers. Figure 54: In Nearmap you can search for Guildford (green marker) to help you locate the study site at the confluence of the Helena and Swan Rivers (Blue shded area) Zoom in so that you can see the vegetation canopy clearly and then use the time bar at the top to look at changes over time (play button will scroll through all available images, clock icon will split the screen so you can compare two different dates. What seasonal changes can you see in the images? How has the vegetation changed between the oldest and the most recent images (compare similar times of year)? As you scroll through time does there seem to be a period of more rapid decline? Are there any periods of recovery? You can also see the distribution of surface water on the Nearmap imagery - compare what you see with the following mapping of surface water inundation at the site. Figure 55: Example inundation pattern. Which way is the water flowing? 3. Mapping salinity (EC) in QGIS Surface water samples from across the site have previously been collected and analysed for electrical conductivity (EC), which is a measure of salinity. Let’s create a map to visualise the spatial variation in salinity across the study site. The following instructions take you through the steps to do this in QGIS, which can be downloaded here. If you are proficient in ArcGIS you can use that instead to create your map. Let’s start by importing our EC point data. Go to Layer -&gt; Add Layer -&gt; Add Delimited Text Layer. Under File name navigate to a csv file of the EC data Make sure under File Format ‘CSV’ is selected Under Geometry Definition set the X field to the Easting column of you EC data and the Y field to the Northing column Set the Geometry CRS to “EPSG:32750 - WGS84/UTM zone 50S” Click Add Figure 56: Importing your EC data. Make sure your data takes this form in Excel. Save it as a CSV: You’ll now see the point data added to your screen, however, we have no spatial context - let’s add a basemap. Go to the QuickMapServices (QMS) button in the toolbar and browse/search for a basemap that you think would be appropriate (e.g. search “satellite” and browse the different satellite basemap providers). Add one to the map. Figure 57: The QMS buttons in the QGIS toolbar. If you do not have the QMS button in your toolbar go Plugins -&gt; Manage and Install Plugins and search ‘QuickMapServices’ to install it. Now we have a basemap and our points - let’s change the symbology of the points to better communicate the variation in EC. Right click on the point data in the layer window and go Properties -&gt; Symbology. Set the symbol type to Graduated and specifying the values to graduate by as our EC column. Now set the Method to Size, and the Mode to Natural Breaks (Jenks), click Classify. Figure 58: Changing the symbology of our point data. Now when you click Apply the point size is weighted to the EC. You can further refine your symbology by changing the point colours and size - think about how best to communicate variation in EC. Finally, create a map output by clicking the New Layout button in the toolbar. If you aren’t familiar with creating maps in QGIS work with one of your classmates who is, or read through the second half of this tutorial. Figure 59: Example map from your QGIS output. 4. Time-series data for assessing groundwater levels and salinity You are provided with a spreadsheet that summarise the timeseries data collected by various agencies (e.g., UWA and DWER (via WIR)). This files includes numerous sheets with the following data notes : Weather: There was a “Baro” dataset, which is a UWA logger measuring atmospheric pressure, in kPa. We measure this as the water levels in the piezometers may vary due to atmospheric pressure fluctuations. For your report you do not need to present this, just bear in mind it was used to “correct” the piezometer water level data. The rainfall provided is from the nearby DPIRD South-Perth weather station. GW Levels: This includes the UWA piezometer level data (converted into mAHD) for the main wells: HW1, HW2, and HW3. Bore 7 is also included which is denoted as Jeremy on the map. GW Salinity: This has the UWA salinity measurements from inside the Piezometers. These data are in mS/cm. Helena River: River Corrected data is the water level of Helena River under the nearby Traffic Bridge. So you can think of this as the water level at the river-end of the piezometer transect. “Poison Lease” (upstream in Helena River to the east of our site). It also has the discharge (Q) at this site, based on a rating curve. Swan River: This has WIR data from the station MSB data as above, including the daily min and mix, showing the tidal amplitude of the Swan River over time. The “Vitox” Salinity data is from the WIR website for the nearby location which is just to the west of our site (on the other side of Kings Meadow Oval). This data indicates the river/estuary salinity and would be very similar to the salinity of the surface water in Helena River near our site also. Note its seasonality, compared to the groundwater. Remember, when working with groundwater data you need to be careful to distinguish between groundwater levels that are reported as a depth to water (from the ground level or top of casing) as opposed to groundwater levels the Australian Height Datum (AHD). If there are measured values of depth to water you need to convert these to elevations in m AHD so they can be compared with the prior data and WIR data. To do this we need to know the ground level elevation at the measurement point, in mAHD (or the elevation of the top of casing, if this was the origin for the measurement). Raw data is often not perfect, so think of some ways to presnet the data. For example, you could make a PIVOT table to look at monthly values. When interpreting the data we would like to highlight seasonality, and also relative differences between sites. Importantly, is there a way to bring togteher the different data into a single plot to help our interpretation of the what is happening at the system. 5. Conceptualising Surface-Groundwater interaction Now that you have an understanding of the previous studies at the site, and have plotted the existing data, the next step is to develop your conceptual model of surface water - groundwater interaction. When trying to make sense of all this data from different locations and time periods some guiding questions can help focus your analyses: How does salinity vary across the surface water sites? How does this relate to sources of water (Helena River, Stormwater from nearby suburbs, Swan estuary, Rain) How does water level and salinity vary in the groundwater based on distance from the river? Are levels in the aquifer higher or lower than the (mean) river level? What about salinity? Do these patterns in groundwater salinity change seasonally? Which flow pathways drive the changes we see? Is water moving vertically or laterally? Consider how water levels in the piezometers vary relative to surface water. Think here Darcy’s Law and Hydraulic gradient. Are is the unsaturated zone (vadose zone) adequate for the tree roots? i.e., is the water table depth deep enough to contain non-salty soil moisture for them, or must they rely on water from salty groundwater? Look here at areas in nearmap where tree loss has occurred. What are the salinity tolerances reported for E. rudis, based on lab/field trials? And how does our data compare to sort of data (historical and our class data). Submission Your report should include: Introduction [1 page maximum] Background and context – why are we interested in this site? Map of site – where specifically are we looking at? Scope of the investigation – what is this report about? Assessment methodology [1 page : be concise!] Desktop assessment, data sources (historical and present) – UWA and external data/info that has been referred to. A table can be convenient to summarise, or a structured list. Data analysis approach, as relevant – any processing or “higher” analysis that was done to the data to make the assessment possible. Results and findings [~3 pages] Map of surface water salinity Time-series graphs of climate, water levels, flows and salinities (or EC) Transect of water level and salinity data across the site Conceptual model of surface and groundwater flow and salt pathways; consider all information in this, including past data and reports and nearmap imagery. Consider how summer may be different to winter! Discussion and conclusions [&lt;1 page] Interpretation of the data presented in light of the observed tree-decline locations Suggestions for improved monitoring and further investigations; dot-points OK here. Your report will be assessed according to the marking rubric on LMS. Submissions not received by the due date will attract a late penalty. References Clay, R., Majer, J. (2001).
