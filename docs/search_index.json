["E1-1.html", "Exercise 1A: Catchment Rainfall and Runoff Part 1: Spatial Rainfall Variability Part 2: Rainfall and Runoff Data Analysis", " Exercise 1A: Catchment Rainfall and Runoff Part 1: Spatial Rainfall Variability Introduction Many factors affect the extent to which the measured rainfall amount at one rain-gauge can be extended to the surrounding area: the distance from the rain-gauge to the centre of the representative area, the size of the area, the topography, the nature of the rainfall quantity (storm event, daily, monthly), the characteristics of the local storm patterns (convective versus low intensity events). Most hydrological analysis at the catchment scale requires knowledge of the areal distribution of precipitation in the form of an average depth (mm) of water for the entire catchment over a specified time period, using information from a set of unevenly placed rain-gauges spread around the area. In order to calculate the flow discharge produced by a large storm (convective type) in the catchment in, it is necessary to calculate the average depth of rainfall (ADR) over the catchment. Three approaches are currently used for estimating the total rainfall: an arithmetic average of gauged quantities, the isohyetal method, and the Thiessen polygon method. In this exercise you will compare these three different approaches for calculating the ADR and runoff generated by a single rainfall event. To annotate this page, make sure you do so in the ‘Hydrology Class 2020’ group - you can join it here. Download the answer sheet for this exercise by clicking the download button in the tool bar . Methods In this exercise you are required to calculate the average rainfall (ADR) over the entire catchment using: the arithmetic mean (considering only stations within the catchment boundary), the Thiessen polygon weighting system, and the Isohyetal method. Rainfall data for each station in the catchment is provide in Table 3. You are then required to produce an estimate of catchment runoff, which we will assume is equal to the stream discharge out of the catchment (\\(Q\\)). Recall from lecture slides that a rough estimate of runoff may be estimated using the total rainfall over the catchment during a given period of time, and a runoff coefficient. Figure 1: A depth of rain (\\(P\\), mm/day) is falling over a catchment area (\\(A\\), km2) to produce stream discharge (\\(Q\\), m3/day). Arithmetic Average The most basic measure of average rainfall depth is the arthimetic average, whereby you sum the observed rainfall at each rain gauge inside the catchment and divide by the number of gauges. Theisson Polygon Method The average depth of rainfall (ADR) over the entire catchment can be calculated using: \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathrm{ADR\\ (mm)\\ =\\ }\\frac{\\sum{A_i\\ast P_i}}{\\sum A_i} \\tag{1} \\end{equation}\\] Where \\(A_{i}\\) is the polygon area (km2), \\(P_{i}\\) is the rainfall (mm) corresponding to the \\(i\\) polygon, and \\(\\sum{A_{i}}\\) is the catchment area (km2). Isohyetal Method The average depth of rainfall over the entire catchment can be calculated using: \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathrm{ADR\\ (mm)\\ =\\ }\\frac{\\sum{A_i\\ast P_i}}{\\sum A_i} \\tag{2} \\end{equation}\\] where in this method \\(A_{i}\\) is the area between isohyets \\(P_{i}\\) and \\(P_{i+1}\\) (km2), \\(P_{i}\\) is the average rainfall (mm) corresponding to the area \\(A_{i}\\) between the isohyets, and \\(\\sum{A_{i}}\\) is the total catchment area (km2). Activity You are given the measured data for each rainfall gauge in Table 1. Calculate the arithmetic mean and write this in your summary table (Table 3). Next work out the ADR based on the other two methods. Once we have computed ADR, we can now estimate the likely amount of runoff. Remember the relationship between rainfall and discharge as outlined in the lecture. You’ll need to choose an appropriate runoff coefficient, and calculate the stream discharge at the bottom of the catchment - rember to watch out for unit conversions! (8 marks).

Thiessen Polygons: Sketch the polygons To construct the Thiessen polygons, first draw dashed straight lines between the gauges. Next, find the mid-points of each of these lines and draw another solid line, perpendicular to the dashed line. These solid lines drawn perpendicular to the dashed lines will meet to form irregular polygons Figure 3: Gridded map for polygon construction and area estimates.

You should always go back to your original objectives (or aims) and see what you have learnt from your analysis. Do this now and briefly summarise the aims of this exercise, your conclusions after doing this analysis, the limitations of your approach, and any recommendations. The aim(s) of this exercise was (2 marks): After doing this exercise I have been able to conclude (4 marks): Limitations, assumptions and sources of error (4 marks): Based on this study I would recommend (3 marks): Part 2: Rainfall and Runoff Data Analysis Introduction The previous exercise focussed on estimating rainfall and runoff at catchment scales during a storm event. This focussed on catchment scale rainfall and processes. In this exercise we will examine the nature of rainfall data and use some simple statistics to describe these data. We then look at how rainfall may be changing over time and how it varies over space across Western Australia. After that we explore how different modes of climate variability affect annual rainfall. Lastly, we look at the relationships between rainfall and runoff. To achieve this, we use a large number of weather stations across WA to quantify the variability of rainfall in space and time. Throughout the exercise we should remember that rainfall will be influenced by a number of processes that operate on different space and time scales (see Figure 5). We will examine these during this exercise. Figure 5: A guide to the timescales applicable to weather, climate variability and climate change Pacific Climate Futures. Objectives By the end of this activity, you should: Be able to source rainfall data, understand the nature of that data and describe it using simple statistics in Excel. Understand how and why rainfall may be changing over time and use statistics and regression to test hypothesis. Know how different modes of climate variability such as IOD and ENSO affect annual rainfall. Determine the relationships between rainfall and runoff to evaluate the nature of the relationship between rainfall and discharge. Statistical Properties of Rainfall Data Individually (make sure you have at least one person per station but you can have more than one if needed). Start by downloading the daily rainfall data for your site from the Bureau of Meteorology web site. Use the site ID to get the data as below. Download and extract the zipped file to get a CSV file that can be opened in Excel. First, let’s plot the time series of DAILY rainfall. Clean up the plot as required and submit on your answer sheet (1 mark). Describe the main features of this data set. What is the most appropriate type of graph for rainfall data? (3 marks) Calculate the annual SUM of rainfall. We want to ensure that there are only whole years to calculate the sums or else they will be in error. Delete the rows of data for the last partial year (2019) and any partial years at the start. Select the required data across multiple columns (year C to rainfall amount F). Then insert PIVOT table (Create a new tab). Select Year and Rainfall amount as the FIELDS. Drag the Year FIELD into the ROWS box. Left click on the “Sum of Year” in the VALUES box and remove it. Plot the annual sums as a timeseries. Clean up the plot as required and submit on your answer sheet (1 mark). What are the main features of this annual data set? What variability can you see? (2 marks) Use the Data Analysis add-in to calculate descriptive statistics (mean annual rainfall, max annual rainfall, min annual rainfall, Standard deviation of annual rainfall, Skewness) for the whole data (you can install by going to Tools-&gt;Add-ins-&gt;Analysis ToolPack). Copy the results here and complete Table 4 for your site (and others when they are done). Describe the values you got and what they mean. How “useful” are these statistics for your understanding of the system? What if any assumptions are there about these statistics? (4 marks) Next, let’s look at the distribution of the rainfall data. Do this by plotting a histogram of the rainfall data (you will need to decide on a reasonable bin size) and plotting the cumulative probability distribution (you can ask Excel to generate this automatically when it makes the histogram, or generate it manually – each data point represents a probability of 1/#data points). What do these plots tell you about the rainfall data? Are the data normally distributed? (2 marks) Plot the seasonal (monthly average) rainfall. Use a PIVOT table again. Insert PIVOT table (select OK to create a new tab). Select Month and Rainfall amount as the FIELDS; drag the Month FIELD into the ROWS box. Left click on the “Sum of Month” in the VALUES box and remove it. Plot the annual sums as a timeseries. Clean up the plot as required and submit on your answer sheet (2 marks). How would you describe the seasonal pattern of rainfall (hint look at the climate type)? What factors may influence it (hint, think about earth orbit)?

How do we frame the hypothesis? What statistical test can we use to test the significance of the hypothesis? Describe the results and conclusions of this analysis. Calculate the appropriate t-value and p-value and enter them also into Table 5. (5 marks) Break into small groups of about 5 and discuss the results of Table 5. Choose a rapporteur to report back at the end of the discussion. Highlight the station where there is a statistically significant slope. Are there statistically significant changes in rainfall? Are they consistent across WA? What may be causing the changes? (5 marks) Spatial patterns in rainfall Take the information in Table 4 and record your values onto the locations of each site on the large class map (whiteboard). Use the maps below to locate your site. When everyone is finished break back into your groups and discuss the results. Choose a new rapporteur to report back at the end of the discussion. Think about the spatial patterns not the temporal ones (i.e climate modes). What spatial patterns might you expect and what do you notice? What may be causing these spatial patterns? (6 marks) Interannual variability in rainfall Here we determine how rainfall correlates with known modes of climate variability (i.e. Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO)). Other indicators of temporal variability (look for cyclic patterns). Does rainfall correlate with known modes of climate variability (i.e. IOD and ENSO using the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI)). SOI is calculated as follows. \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{SOI} = 10 \\frac{P_{\\text{diff}} - P_{\\text{diffav}}}{SD(P_{\\text{diff}})} \\tag{3} \\end{equation}\\] Where: \\(P_{\\text{diff}}\\) = (average Tahiti MSLP for the month) - (average Darwin MSLP for the month) \\(P_{\\text{diffav}}\\) = long term average of \\(P_{\\text{diff}}\\) for the month in question, and \\(SD(P_{\\text{diff}})\\) = long term standard deciation of \\(P_{\\text{diff}}\\) for the month in question. IOD is calculated by anomalous Sea Surface Temperature gradient between the western equatorial Indian Ocean (50E-70E and 10S-10N) and the south eastern equatorial Indian Ocean (90E-110E and 10S-0N) in units of degrees Kelvin. We will use the extremely useful Climate Explorer for the next section. First you will need to register so you can save data series. Access the rainfall from the previous site that you used in the previous section. Click on “Monthly Station Data” (right hand menu), select “precipitation” from the “GHCN-M (all)” column, search for your station (e.g. type BROOME in the “Select stations” section), and then press “Get stations”. If the selection works you will see relevant stations listed, and then click “get data”. You will then see graphs and options for further integrating the data. Make a name to save the data (the default should be fine). Click “Add to list”. Now get the first climate index for the IOD called the DMI. Go to “Monthly climate indices” and then select DMI. Note any trend and variability in the index. To correlate the index and rainfall select “Correlate with other time series”. And tick your previously saved rainfall timeseries and then press “Correlate” and copy the results into Table 6. Table 6: Rainfall and climate indices (DMI for IOD and SOI for ENSO) correlations (1 mark). Month DMI Corr DMI p-value SOI Corr SOI p-value Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Break into small groups of about 5 and discuss the results of your correlations. Choose a new rapporteur to report back at the end of the discussion. Highlight any months that have a significant p-value (&lt;0.05). What relationships do you see between rainfall and climate mode and why? Do they correlate in specific seasons? How strong are these correlations really? How are they consistent or different across WA? (6 marks) We can do the same exercise except using gridded data (climate data divided into say 0.5 degree spacing using reanalysis information). Click on “Monthly observations” and go to Precipitation CRU TS 0.5. We then want to correlate each grid cell on the earth with our climate index (SOI and DMI) to see how the correlations very spatially. Click on “Correlate with a time series” and choose either SOI or DMI. Then click correlate at the bottom and wait (the calculations are being done online and the graph returned for viewing). Do the same for both SOI and DMI. Break into small groups of about 5 and discuss the results of your plots. Choose a new rapporteur to report back at the end of the discussion. For DMI which month had the highest (negative) correlation (copy that plot to your results). What areas of Australia have significant correlations and what time of year? For SOI which month had the highest (positive) correlation (copy that plot to your results). What areas of Australia have significant correlations and what time of year? Does this match with your own rainfall station correlations (6 marks)? Relationship between rainfall and runoff Examine the relationship between annual rainfall and annual Runoff. Go the Department of Water web site. Use this tool to locate a gauging station near your rainfall site. Add the site to your cart and submit a data request - check that the data is being delivered as a “package of pre-computed reports”. You will then be emailed a zip file of the station’s data. Ensure the station has 10-20 years of available data for this exercise. Plot a scatter plot of discharge and annual rainfall, add a line to the chart. Break into small groups of about 5 and discuss the results of your plots. Choose a new rapporteur to report back at the end of the discussion. What are the relationships between rainfall and discharge? Are they linear or non- linear and why? Are they consistent across WA? (4 marks) "],
["E2-1.html", "Streamflow Lab Measuring Stream Velocity &amp; Discharge Making Sense of Streamflow Data", " Streamflow Lab In this module we understand how to generate streamflow data, and then how to charcaterise variability in streamflow data. Measuring Stream Velocity &amp; Discharge The process of measuring stream flow (volume rate of flow), or discharge, is called stream gauging. There are numerous methods of stream gauging, including direct methods, such as volumetric gauging, and dilution methods, as well as indirect methods involving stage-discharge relations, or rating curves. Since the velocity of a stream varies with depth and width across a stream, it is important to understand what it is you want to measure when choosing a stream gauging method. If you are interested in stream surface velocity, a simple float method would work well. This method involves throwing some buoyant, highly visible object into the stream and measuring the time it takes to float a known distance. If you are interested in obtaining a more accurate stream discharge measurement, the velocity-area method is your method of choice. Stream flow (discharge) can be measured based on two fundamental methods, which are each expanded upon below (refer to lecture 3 for details). The first requires a direct measurement of velocity, whereas the second is an approximation based on stream-bed slope and geometry. Flow Rate: Velocity-Area Method Flow estimates in natural streams and artificial channels under steady (no change in depth with time) and uniform (no change in depth with space) conditions can be computed by the product of mean flow velocity (integrated in depth and across the channel) and the cross-sectional area of flow. The equation \\(Q = V * A\\), were \\(V\\) (m/s) is the mean velocity and \\(A\\) (m2) is the flow (or water) cross-sectional area is used for this purpose. Large streams and rivers, a section control is needed to generate the “rating curve” thus establishing a relationship between water stage height (\\(H\\)) and flow discharge (\\(Q\\)). In this case, both flow velocity measurements and cross-sectional areas are needed. Discharge using the Velocity-Area method is measured by integrating the area and velocity of each point across the stream. The channel or stream is divided into sections based on where the velocity and stage height measurements were taken in the cross-section of the stream/channel. The flow velocity is measured using a current meter (i.e. propeller, electromagnetic, ultrasonic, and Doppler). The discharge is computed using: \\[\\begin{equation} Q = \\sum^{n}_{i=0} (V_{i} * \\text{Area}_{i}) \\tag{4} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(n\\) is the number of vertical for measuring velocities, \\(V_{i}\\) is the mean velocity value for vertical \\(i\\) (m/s) and \\(\\text{Area}_i\\) is the cross-sectional area around vertical \\(i\\) (m2). The cross-sectional area is best estimated by treating the sections as rectangles, trapezia or triangles. Figure 6: Current-meter discharge measurements are made by determining the discharge in each subsection of a channel cross section and summing the subsection discharges to obtain a total discharge. To measure stream velocity we can utilise a “swoffer” – a pole with a propeller on the end with an electronic logger recording the rotations. A current meter is so designed that its rotation speed varies linearly with the stream velocity at the location of the instrument. A more modern alternative is an “ADV” (Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter). This relies on a method where it looks at the scatter of sound waves rebounding of particles/bubbles in the water, and based on the “Doppler effect” (recall the sound of a train changing pitch as it moves past you), it can compute the water velocity. Figure 7: An ADV - used to measure stream velocity. Activity: Look at the demonstration in the lab and videos below showing the principles of how to measure the velocity of water, and compute the total channel discharge based on the cross-sectional area. Flow Rate: Manning’s Formula Manning’s formula for estimating runoff (in m3s-1) from basic channel geometry, slope and roughness is: \\[\\begin{equation} Q = \\frac{1}{n}(A\\space{}R^{\\frac{2}{3}}\\space{}S^{\\frac{1}{2}}) \\tag{5} \\end{equation}\\] Where: \\(A\\) is the channel cross-sectional area (m2) ; \\(R\\) is the hydraulic radius given by \\(\\frac{A}{P}\\) ; \\(P\\) is the wetted perimeter (i.e. bed plus banks; m); \\(S\\) is the channel slope (m/m); \\(n\\) is Manning’s ‘n’ (which is an empirical roughness coefficient). In the field: The bottom slope (\\(S\\)) will be estimated by using a differential GPS (DGPS). Conduct this by averaging the slope (m/m) for two reaches, one upstream and one downstream of the measurement point Estimate the ‘wetted perimeter’ (\\(P\\)) of the channel and cross sectional area (\\(A\\)) The roughness coefficient (\\(n\\)) should be assumed from the literature, based on your observations and using a photograph of the channel. Then use the table below: Activity: Look at the demonstration models in the lab of the two example river/floodplain cross-sections. Assuming these are a scale model of a real-world river channel, compute the discharge. Sketch and use the scale to get the channel dimensions Estimate the “wetted perimeter” Compute a slope parameter, \\(S\\), assume for every 1km of stream length, the stream bed drops by 1m Estimate the cross-sectional area; the area “normal” (perpendicular) to the flow velocity Estimate a roughness parameter, Manning’s \\(n\\), and solve Equation (5) Repeat the above, assuming the water level was at “bankfull” height Making Sense of Streamflow Data The first step in any hydrologic data analysis project is to gather the data and relevant background information on your catchment of interest. In Western Australia the WIR website contains all of the data and information you need, and we will use this in our future assignments. All states/countries have something similar; the USA has one of the best examples through the USGS NWIS website. If you click the site information button, enter your gage name or number, and browse the available datasets for your river. For this analysis, you will need daily discharge data, peak streamflow, and the annual water data report. Other datasets may also be helpful for understanding the hydrologic behavior of your river. Hydrologic analyses are almost always conducted for “water years” not calendar years. In the Northern Hemisphere. A water year begins on October 1 and ends September 30 . In the Southern Hemisphere it Starts May 1 and ends April 30, though this can be region specific. Daily Unit Discharge Hydrograph Figure 8: The Avon River, Western Australia Unit discharge is the total discharge of the river divided by the watershed area. Thus, it has units of m3/s/km2. Unit discharge is very useful for comparing the hydrologic behaviour of catchments of different size (since discharge scales with area). Depending on your data source you will need to download data and do appropriate conversions in a spreadsheet. A properly formatted unit discharge hydrograph has a descriptive title, labelled axes, and a logarithmic y-axis. If you need help with formatting the graph in Excel, please don’t hesitate to ask for help! Activity: Go to the WIR web link, and download the continuous flow data for the Swan River “Walyunga” gauge (616011). In Excel, explore the data. Create a hydrograph comparing discharge between a wet year and a dry year (i.e. plot two years on a common x-axis. Use “hydrologic years” rather than calendar years. Label accordingly. Repeat the exercise but this time creating a unit hydrograph - for this you will need to divide by the catchment area; refer to the above information and check units are consistent. This gauge is draining the Avon catchment Figure 9: Navigate to the ‘Walyunga’ guage (616011) Flow Duration Curves What is it? The flow duration curve is a plot that shows the percentage of time that flow in a stream is likely to equal or exceed some specified value of interest. For example, it can be used to show the percentage of time river flow can be expected to exceed a design flow of some specified value (e.g., 20 m3/s), or to show the discharge of the stream that occurs or is exceeded some percent of the time (e.g., 80% of the time). How is it calculated? The basic time unit used in preparing a flow-duration curve will greatly affect its appearance. For most studies, mean daily discharges are used. These will give a steep curve. When the mean flow over a long period is used (such as mean monthly flow), the resulting curve will be flatter due to averaging of short-term peaks with intervening smaller flows during a month. Extreme values are averaged out more and more, as the time period gets larger (e.g., for a flow duration curve based on annual flows at a long-record station). Step 1: Sort (rank) average daily discharges for period of record from the largest value to the smallest value, involving a total of \\(n\\) values. Step 2: Assign each discharge value a rank (\\(M\\)), starting with 1 for the largest daily discharge value. Step 3: Calculate exceedence probability (\\(P\\)) as follows: \\[\\begin{equation} P = 100 * [\\frac{M}{n+1}] \\tag{6} \\end{equation}\\] Where, \\(P\\) = the probability that a given flow will be equaled or exceeded (% of time), \\(M\\) = the ranked position on the listing (dimensionless), and \\(n\\) = the number of events for period of record (dimensionless). Activity: Follow the above steps using the 616011 gauge data to create your own flow duration curve. What does this particular information tell you about your stream? A flow duration curve characterizes the ability of the basin to provide flows of various magnitudes. Information concerning the relative amount of time that flows past a site are likely to equal or exceed a specified value of interest is extremely useful for the design of structures on a stream. For example, a structure can be designed to perform well within some range of flows, such as flows that occur between 20 and 80% of the time (or some other selected interval). The shape of a flow-duration curve in its upper and lower regions is particularly significant in evaluating the stream and basin characteristics. The shape of the curve in the high-flow region indicates the type of flood regime the basin is likely to have, whereas, the shape of the low-flow region characterizes the ability of the basin to sustain low flows during dry seasons. A very steep curve (high flows for short periods) would be expected for rain-caused floods on small watersheds. Snowmelt floods, which last for several days, or regulation of floods with reservoir storage, will generally result in a much flatter curve near the upper limit. In the low-flow region, an intermittent stream would exhibit periods of no flow, whereas, a very flat curve indicates that moderate flows are sustained throughout the year due to natural or artificial streamflow regulation, or due to a large groundwater capacity which sustains the base flow to the stream. An example, properly formatted flow duration curve is shown below (Figure 10). Figure 10: Aproperly formatted flow duration curve Flood Frequency Analysis What is it? Flood frequency analyses are used to predict design floods for sites along a river. The technique involves using observed annual peak flow discharge data to calculate statistical information such as mean values, standard deviations, skewness, and recurrence intervals. These statistical data are then used to construct frequency distributions, which are graphs and tables that tell the likelihood of various discharges as a function of recurrence interval or exceedence probability. Flood frequency distributions can take on many forms according to the equations used to carry out the statistical analyses. Four of the common forms are: Normal Distribution; Log-Normal Distribution; Gumbel Distribution; and Log-Pearson Type III Distribution. Each distribution can be used to predict design floods; however, there are advantages and disadvantages of each technique. While the log Pearson Type III distribution is the recommended technique, its application is a bit more complex than we are going to undertake for this class. Instead, we will use the older Weibull plotting position method. Flood frequency information can be determined from knowledge of the peak discharge (highest discharge) in any given year provided enough years of information has been collected. This allows one to relate the expected recurrence interval for a given discharge, and determine the probability that a flood of a given discharge will occur in any given year. The recurrence interval for a given discharge can be calculated by first ranking the discharges. Activity: In Table 7 below for “Big River”, fill in the Rank column. To do this, enter a 1 for the maximum discharge that has occurred during the 20 years of available data. The second highest discharge will be given a rank of 2, etc. with the lowest discharge given a value of 20. Table 7: Complete the table for ‘Big River’ Date Maximum Discharge (m3/s), \\(Q\\) Rank, \\(m\\) Recurrence Interval, \\(R\\) 28-Feb-86 1410 4-Mar-87 2890 22-Mar-88 1850 3-Mar-89 800 1-Feb-90 1000 12-Apr-91 692 4-Apr-92 1350 2-May-93 1200 16-Mar-94 850 6-Jul-95 2400 21-Feb-96 890 30-Jan-97 1480 16-Mar-98 1500 21-Feb-99 1300 12-May-00 1700 8-Apr-01 2200 1-Mar-02 1830 8-Feb-03 1120 12-Mar-04 750 6-Mar-05 1250 After you have filled in the Rank column, you can now calculate the recurrence interval for each peak discharge. The recurrence interval, \\(R\\), is given by the Weibull Equation: \\[\\begin{equation} R = \\frac{n+1}{m} \\tag{7} \\end{equation}\\] Where \\(n\\) is the number of years over which the data was collected (20 years in this case), and \\(m\\) is the rank of each peak discharge. Use this equation to calculate the recurrence interval for each peak discharge. Next, use the graph below to plot a graph of discharge (on the y-axis) versus recurrence interval (on the x-axis). Note that the x-axis is a logarithmic scale, and thus you should try to estimate as best you can where the data point will fall between the lines on the graph. Once you have plotted the points use a ruler to draw the best fit straight line through the data points (lay a ruler on the graph and try to draw a line that most closely approximates all of the data points). Do not draw lines that connect individual data points. By extrapolating your line on the graph, determine the peak discharge expected in a flood with a recurrence interval of 50 years and 100 years. These are the discharges expected in a 50 year flood and a 100 year flood. The annual exceedence probability, \\(P_{e}\\), is the probability that a given discharge will occur in a given year. It is calculated as the inverse of the recurrence interval, \\(R\\): \\[\\begin{equation} P_{e} = \\frac{1}{R} \\tag{8} \\end{equation}\\] Thus, the probability that a flood with a 10 year recurrence interval will occur in any year is 1/10 = 0.1 or 10%. What are the probabilities that a 50 year flood and a 100 year flood will occur in any given year? Extra activity: Repeat the above flood frequency analysis using the 616011 Walyunga data set that you downloaded in Excel (Hint, use a pivot table and the max option to get the annual maximum discharge).

["E5-1.html", "Characterising Soil Moisture", " Characterising Soil Moisture This is a simple introductory experiment to learn how to compute the essential characteristics of soil, relevant to hydrology. We will refer again to this data when doing subsequent activities. For this activity we will collect soil from the locations and make three replicates at each. For students attending in-person: Please attend the AGRIG215 lab during your allocated time-slot to collect a pack with sample bags and required equipment. Sign-out a GPS unit to record your sample locations. Seek to find three locations across UWA or Matilda Bay reserve where you can easily access surface soil to a depth of 10cm. Identify sites with contrasting soil types or surface properties, noting the site features. DO NOT TAKE SAMPLES FROM JAMES OVAL OR THE GARDENS. ONCE YOU HAVE YOUR SAMPLE REPLACE THE DISTURBED SOIL. Using the core provided, collect a volume of soil and place into the bag. Repeat 2 more times using a similar method from 1-2 m away. Note the UTM co-ordinates of your sample. Note the volume of the soil core. Try to be consistent with how you pack the core between samples. Once you have collected your samples, return to the AGRI lab, weigh each, and place in an oven at 105˚C. Please ensure your samples are labelled correctly. Make sure you correctly blank the balance to account for the sample container weight. Leave your samples overnight, and return tomorrow at your convenience to re-weigh the dried samples. Use the data to compute soil moisture and porosity of each sample following the instructions below. For students undertaking at home: Please seek to find three locations nearby to you where you can easily access surface soil to a depth of 10cm. Using a trowel, clear the ground surface and use a small “core” (e.g. measuring cup or inverted can) to collect your samples. You will need to know your sample size and volume. Place into a small tray or bag that is suitable for going into the oven. For each sample use a kitchen balance to record the sample weight. Make sure you correctly blank the balance to account for the sample container weight. Then place into the oven for drying at ~105˚C. Leave in the oven for 1-2 hours and then re-weigh. Use the data to compute soil moisture and porosity of each sample following the instructions below. Figure 11: Equipment required for collecting soil samples. Computing Soil Porosity and Soil Moisture Referring to the above collected soils. For each we will measure the soil mass before and after drying in the oven. The mass difference after oven drying is the weight of water contained in that soil volume. Based on this water mass we can work out the gravimetric and/or volumetric water content of that soil. We can also look at the mass and volume and work out the soil bulk density and porosity. These are essential measures for assessing water holding capacity of soils. For the soils indicated, we will take samples and measure the moisture content. Taking the mass before placing in an oven gives an estimate of the initial amount of water in the soil matrix prior to the drying. The volumetric water content (VWC, \\(\\theta\\), theta), is calculated from the mass of wet and oven dried samples and taking into account the total sample volume: \\[\\begin{equation} \\theta=\\frac{V_w}{V_T}=\\frac{\\left(M_{\\text{sample}}-M_{\\text{dry}}\\right)}{V_T\\ \\rho_w} \\tag{9} \\end{equation}\\] We can also calculate the bulk density of the soil, and therefore the porosity of the soil. Bulk density \\(\\rho_b\\) is the mass of dry soil per unit volume. To determine the bulk density you need to know the volume of the column (\\(\\pi r^2 h\\)) where \\(r\\) is radius and \\(h\\) is height of soil in the sample. Remember that clayey soil contains considerable amounts of water under air dry conditions. From the bulk density and particle density \\(\\rho_p\\) (2.65 g cm-3) one can calculate the porosity \\(\\phi=\\ \\left(1-\\frac{\\rho_b}{\\rho_p}\\right)\\). Repeat the above for each soil for three replicates. Enter data into the Table 8, and the online Google sheet. You can estimate the water storage potential, \\(S_{\\text{max}}\\) of a region by multiplying the soil volume by the porosity: \\[\\begin{equation} S_{max}=\\ \\phi{\\ V}_{soil} \\tag{10} \\end{equation}\\] Using a large sample of soil, estimate the infiltration of the soil using the Decagon infiltrometer, enter the data into the sheet supplied.

This is waterlogged soil. Field capacity: moisture content remaining in soil subjected to -0.033MPa (0.3Bar) pressure (i.e. slight vacuum). Capillary action, osmotic pressure and gravity are balanced at this point. Excess water has moved to lower layers as groundwater recharge. Permanent Wilting Point: moisture content remaining in soil subjected to -1.50MPa (15 Bar) pressure (i.e. moderate vacuum). Plant roots can’t extract any more water (i.e. apply a suction stronger than -1.5 MPa) from this soil and begin to die. Available Water Content = Field Capacity – Permanent Wilting Point. This is the amount moisture available for plants to extract. "],
["E4-1.html", "Exercise 1B Part 1: Surface-Ground Water Interaction - Desktop Catchment", " Exercise 1B Part 1: Surface-Ground Water Interaction - Desktop Catchment Overview In this experiment, you will use data loggers to record streamflow in an experimental catchment during a rainfall event, and calculate the relative contributions of pre-event and event water to that streamflow. The real-world setting for the experiment is a gaining stream (Figure 12). A question we often want to be able to answer is how much groundwater is contributing to flow in a river, and how much is water that came from recent rainfall. This is relevant for water resources planning so we can work out the discharge rate of an aquifer, or for water quality management. Groundwater usually has different chemical characteristics to storm runoff during a rainfall event and we can use this chemical signal as a tracer for groundwater contribution. In this experiment you will demonstrate how groundwater (pre-event water) contribution to river flow changes over the course of a storm event, relative to water that fell as rain during the storm event (event water). You will use the tracer dilution technique using salinity (measured as electrical conductivity, EC) as the groundwater tracer. The experimental set-up consists of a tray of soil, the ability to add rainfall (via a connection to the tap) and discharge outlets at the bottom of the catchment. During the experiment loggers will measure rainfall amount as well as streamflow and EC at the catchment outlet over time (Figure 13). Figure 12: Groundwater discharge to a gaining stream. Figure 13: Experimental setup showing the catchment tray, rainfall, sprinklers and logger location. Method Step 1 Set up your apparatus. There are loggers for rainfall, streamflow and EC that are connected to a computer. Follow the instructions provided VERY carefully to make sure that you record and save your data correctly. Do not proceed until you understand how the loggers work. Also make sure that all but one outlet in the bottom layer of drain outlets are blocked with rubber bungs or stickers before proceeding (Figure 14). Step 2 Create your “aquifer” by loading the bottom of your tray with some of the provided river sand mix. Smooth the top surface so that it is an even thickness across the catchment and then estimate the volume of this layer. The top of aquifer should sit below the top line of outlets as shown in Figure 14. Take a core to sample the soil, and compute the starting soil moisture (refer to the method here). Now saturate the sand with saline water, making sure to note the EC of the saline solution. Remove any excess ponded water with a syringe before proceeding. Figure 14: Saturated aquifer correctly set up within catchment model. Step 3 Now overlay the saturated soil layer with a second layer of dry soil, being careful not to disturb the original layer. Shape the new upper layer into the shape of a catchment (concave) so that when the subsurface fills up there will be a stream flowing to the catchment outlet (Figure 15). The middle outlet in the top layer should NOT be covered with soil, but the soil should be just below this outlet. You will see some capillary rise of your aquifer water into the vadose zone. Make sure the rainfall outlets are close to the catchment surface. Then turn the tubes at the bottom of the catchment so that they are directed into the PVC drain and you’re ready to go! Figure 15: Unsaturated zone on to of aquifer. Topography should slope towards the middle and the catchment outlet. Step 4 When you are ready to run the experiment, prepare a stop-watch and turn on the logger software in the computer. Now you can turn the tap on to get the rainfall flowing – make sure it is a reasonable flow that is not too high or too low (i.e. it is clearly visible on the scale on the logging software, somewhere between 2.5 and 3). Leave the rain on for approximately 20 minutes until the catchment has filled up, stream flow has begun and the EC at the catchment outlet has clearly decreased (Figure 16). Figure 16: Streamflow at the catchment outlet. Step 5 Now you can turn the rain off, but make sure you leave the loggers on, we want to see what happens after the rain is finished. Run the experiment for another 20 minutes or until the streamflow has ceased if you have time. Make sure you save the experimental data as a .csv file. Step 6 Analyse the data. Before you can do this you might need to clean the data – remove any outliners and identify where your experimental data start and stop. You have very high temporal resolution data, which might not be ideal for the sensitivity of your loggers. Consider calculating a running average to get smooth temporal trends. Once you are happy with your clean data set you can use the logged data to identify the properties of the storm event, including: Time from rainfall onset to when runoff began to be recorded (mins), Time to peak discharge (mins), Total rainfall volume (cm3), Total runoff volume (cm3), Average rainfall intensity (cm/min), The runoff coefficient, \\(c\\), for the ‘storm’ event. Step 7 Interpret the data. What were the relative contributions of pre-event (baseflow) and event water? Now that you’ve familiarised yourself with the rainfall event, you can: Estimate the initial “aquifer” storage of saline water (cm3). Assume that the porosity of the dry soil is 0.25 Calculate and plot the hydrograph (cm3/s): \\(Q_{\\text{out}}(t) = Q_{\\text{event}} + Q_{\\text{pre-event}}\\) Using the tracer dilution method (see below) calculate the fraction of the hydrograph that is from baseflow. How does this change over time? Comment on attributes of the experimental setup that would have increased or decreased baseflow contribution. How realistic is the experiment in terms of capturing the interaction of surface vs groundwater? Is the change in \\(Q_{\\text{pre-event}}/Q_{\\text{event}}\\) over time what you would expect? We can estimate the groundwater contribution to the streamflow by looking at changes in EC. If EC in groundwater is at a pre-event reference level, \\(S_{\\text{pre-event}}\\), EC in the rain \\(S_{\\text{event}}\\) is almost 0, then the level of dilution in EC in streamflow can be used to estimate the fraction of event and pre-event (groundwater baseflow) contributing to streamflow: \\(S_{\\text{tot}} * Q_{\\text{tot}} = S_{\\text{event}} * Q_{\\text{event}} + S_{\\text{pre-event}} * Q_{\\text{pre-event}}\\) If \\(S_{\\text{event}} = 0\\), then: \\(Q_{\\text{pre-event}} = S_{\\text{out}}*Q_{\\text{out}} / S_{\\text{pre-event}}\\) \\(Q_{\\text{event}} = Q_{\\text{out}} - Q_{\\text{pre-event}}\\) Submission Submission: Prepare a concise report summarising the experiment (~4 pages).

["E4-13.html", "Exercise 1B Part 2: Helena River Site Visit", " Exercise 1B Part 2: Helena River Site Visit Background The degradation of freshwater systems by increasing salinity is a major challenge facing Western Australia. Salinisation of the Avon river, which enters the Upper Swan river at Walyunga National Park, arose due to poor land-management leading to secondary salinity in the inland wheatbelt catchments. Whilst secondary salinity is not an issue in the Swan Coastal Plain where our site visit is, the salt loads from the Avon in addition to rising sea levels and decreasing rainfall trend have been driving changes in the seasonal movement of marine waters, with increasing penetration of the salt wedge further inland from the ocean (Huang et al. 2018). Salinisation of river systems can cause shifts in floodplain vegetation which arise because of river water interaction with the floodplain. Depending on the salinity increase and the salt tolerance of the floodplain tree species, this can cause shifts in community structure. One important species that has a natural range along the Swan river and its tributaries is the Eucalyptus rudis. This species has been reported to be in decline for over 15 years along the Swan river (Clay &amp; Majer 2001), and more recently along one of the tributaries of the Swan river: the Guildford floodplains of the Helena river (Dundas 2011). It is currently unknown the exact role of water availability and salinity in the observed decline, and alternate hypothesis related to tree pathogens (e.g. Phytophthora) are also as drivers of decline are also under investigation. E. rudis plays a vital role in the riparian ecosystem. Riparian woodland species are important filters that reduce nutrient transfers from the land into the river, which is a significant issue in the Swan river and its tributaries (excessive nutrients have historically resulted in noxious algal blooms). There is therefore a need to better understand what drives decline and if projected drying conditions for the region will make the pressures worse. This site visit allows students to experience how hydrologic monitoring of surface- and ground-water systems can help us build a conceptual understanding of how ecosystems are working, and to link this to management challenges that require a solution. The data being collected will help us understand the drivers of decline of E. rudis in relation to the changing hydrology regime at the Guildford floodplains along the Helena river. This site is part of a long-term research investigation being undertaken with the WA Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions (DBCA) and UWA and your data will contribute to our database. During our visit, we will describe the site by considering hydrologic pathways (surface and sub-surface), and collect data to assess water and salt distribution in this floodplain system. You will be shown around the site to explain the basic surface and groundwater processes occurring, and in groups you will: Identify the surface water flow regime. Observe soils and their hydraulic properties. Undertake salinity data collection from groundwater wells (piezometers) and surface waters, and from soils within the tree root zone. Conceptualise the hydrologic processes influencing salt movement and accumulation across the site Identify the distressed and dead trees and consider how hydrology may or may not be abel to explain this issue Figure 17: High-resolution LIDAR image of the surface topography of the Helena River study site in Guildford. The red-circles indicate groundwater observation wells. Helena River Floodplain Field Visit Tasks: For those attending in-person On arrival Arrive at the carpark near King’s Meadow Oval. Firstly check-in with an instructor and get your bearings. You will take a pack with you, and other equipment you will see at the stations. During your site visit you will be instructed to follow the tasks below and record your data in the download sheet . If in doubt, please ask for assistance. You will undertake 4 main activities. Note that each participant is expected to make a short video of one of these tasks (see Submission section at the end). Task A – Surface Water Flows and Salinity Explore the site, considering the surface water pathways. Be able to identify flow direction in the main waterways bounding the site (Swan River to the west and Helena River to the south-east). Be able to identify water accumulation areas within the site itself. Consider the horizontal and vertical movement pathways of this water. Identify Eucalyptus rudis trees and their health in context of the landscape. Measure at two contrasting locations surface water salinity, and on the data sheet. Include the GPS locations. Take one from East of the bridge, and one from the West. You can Take them from Helena or Swan river, and one from an internal site. We will collate data from students to make a class data summary. Use waders provided for deeper waters – use a stick/ruler to judge depth of water before taking steps and do not enter into fast-running water above knee height. Figure 18: Example inundation pattern. Which way is the water flowing? Task B – Helena River Flow Navigate to the Helena River, where it flows under the Bridge. Undertake a stream gauging measurement to determine the river flow. Refer to the Streamflow lab “Velocity-Area method”. Task C – Groundwater sampling Visit two of the existing piezometer wells (refer to map below, consult instructor for locations if you cant find them). Note the Well Identification Number. Record results from the following tasks: Record the depth from the water to the top of the casing. Use the “dipper” provided. Record the depth from the Top of the Casing (TOC) to the ground level. “Bail the well” with the bailer, and take a sample of the water for salinity determination (measure EC of the groundwater). Consider the hydraulic slope – how do you think the height of the water table varies along the transect. Try sketching a cross-section along the transect, and consider how you would apply Darcy’s Law. Task D – Soil salinity In this task we want to expand our data beyond the transect of bores more widely. Identify a soil/groundwater sampling location away from the piezometer transect – including on the east side of the bridge (consult instructor for guidance). Take an exact GPS reading to log your site. Split the tasks below between your team mates: Measure the soil salinity of a sample at the surface, and 20 cm below the surface. Note soil salinity measurement is different from the water salinity measurement. Use the hand auger, drill to reach the water table (~ 50cm) below the surface (this may vary depending on the exact site chosen). Carefully extract the soil, without the hole collapsing. Once settled (~5-10mins), take an EC reading of the water pooling in the bottom, and note the water level below the ground surface. Take caution the depth is accurate relative to the pre-disturbed surface. [OPTIONAL] Whilst the above is being done, in a nearby location, prepare a flat soil surface and undertake an infiltration assessment with the Decagon infiltrometer. Notie the infiltration volume for later entry into the Decagon spreadsheet. You will need to note the soil type, based on your observation. Helena River Floodplain Field Visit Tasks: For those undertaking online Task Z For those not attending the site visit in person, your activity will be to learn about the site by reviewing prior analyses that have been undertaken and looking at historical data for the site. You will additionally be able to see specific aspects of the site by reviewing the short videos made by participants who report on Tasks A-D. Make a summary of the past investigations by reading through the recent report on the site: Mapping EC in QGIS Now that we have collected our data, let’s create a map to visualise the variation in EC over the study site. We will need QGIS for this exercise, if you don’t already have it installed on your computer you can download it here. Let’s start by importing our EC point data. Go to Layer -&gt; Add Layer -&gt; Add Delimited Text Layer. Under File name navigate to your csv of the EC data Make sure under File Format ‘CSV’ is selected Under Geometry Definition set the X field to the Easting column of you EC data and the Y field to the Northing column Set the Geometry CRS to “EPSG:32750 - WGS84/UTM zone 50S” Click Add Figure 19: Importing your EC data. Make sure your data takes this form in Excel. Save it as a CSV: You’ll now see the point data added to your screen, however, we have no spatial context - let’s add a basemap. Go to the QuickMapServices (QMS) button in the toolbar and browse/search for a basemap that you think would be appropriate (e.g. search “satellite” and browse the different satellite basemap providers). Add one to the map. Figure 20: The QMS buttons in the QGIS toolbar. If you do not have the QMS button in your toolbar go Plugins -&gt; Manage and Install Plugins and search ‘QuickMapServices’ to install it. Now we have a basemap and our points - let’s change the symbology of the points to better communicate the variation in EC. Right click on the point data in the layer window and go Properties -&gt; Symbology. Set the symbol type to Graduated and specifying the values to graduate by as our EC column. Now set the Method to Size, and the Mode to Natural Breaks (Jenks), click Classify. Figure 21: Changing the symbology of our point data. Now when you click Apply the point size is weighted to the EC. You can further refine your symbology by changing the point colours and size - think about how best to communicate variation in EC. Finally, create a map output by clicking the New Layout button in the toolbar. If you aren’t familiar with creating maps in QGIS work with one of your classmates who is, or read through the second half of this tutorial. Figure 22: Example map from your QGIS output. Submission Vignette (5 marks): Each participant will record a video summary of a chosen TASK (A-Z). The video should take 1min to explain the context, and describe the method relevant to that task. It is aimed at your fellow peers, such that even without attending the site, they can understand the general issues and the reason for approach being taken. A guide as to what the summary should include is shown in the following: A statement setting the broad context and setting A description of the issue being assessed, and why it is relevant to do the relevant task/measurements An overview of the method A statement about how this data can be used to improve our understanding of the site and help management Note: the Vignette is due to be uploaded by 10am Monday 31st August Peer review (3 marks): Note: the Peer review will be completed by 5pm Friday 4th September Site Assessment report (12 marks): Note: the Site Assessment report is due to be uploaded by 5pm Tuesday 15th September "],
["M6-1.html", "Darcy’s Law Darcy Tubes Physical model of groundwater system Computer model of groundwater system", " Darcy’s Law In this session we will understand Darcy’s Law, and investigate the patterns and rates of groundwater flow within a layered groundwater system. Darcy Tubes As a first step lets consider the experiment of Henry Darcy that first described the flux law for groundwater flow. To do this we use simple “Darcy tubes” that allow us to measure the relationships between rates of groundwater flow, hydraulic gradients and the hydraulic conductivity of the porous media that it flows through. Groundwater flow is driven by the distribution of water pressure (hydraulic head, which has units of length) within the groundwater system. The flow of groundwater follows a flux law; \\[\\begin{equation} q=\\frac{Q}{A}=-K \\frac{\\Delta h}{\\Delta l} \\tag{11} \\end{equation}\\] Where \\(q\\) is the specific discharge (or Darcy Flux) with units of L T-1, \\(Q\\) is the volumetric flow rate (L3 T-1), \\(A\\) is the cross-sectional area through which the water flow (L2), and \\(\\frac{\\Delta h}{ \\Delta l}\\) is the hydraulic gradient. This gradient is simply the change in water pressure (\\(h_1-h_2\\)) over a given distance (L/L, unitless). The key system property in this flux law is the hydraulic conductivity (\\(K\\)), which has units of L T-1. In natural groundwater systems the value of hydraulic conductivity can vary over 12 orders of magnitude. Even though this water flux \\(q\\) has units of L T-1, it’s not actually the velocity of the groundwater, because the water wasn’t flowing through the whole area, just the pore space. To correct for this and calculate the average velocity we need to use the area of the pore space (\\(An\\), where \\(n\\) is porosity), instead of the total area. This gives us; \\[\\begin{equation} \\bar{v}=\\ \\frac{Q}{An}=-\\frac{K}{n} \\frac{\\Delta h}{\\Delta l} \\tag{12} \\end{equation}\\] Where \\(\\bar{v}\\) is the average linear velocity of the water flowing through the porous media. Now that we know these simple equations we can get started with our experiments. To use a Darcy Tube we measure the flow rate through the tube for a chosen soil material. For each porous material, the tube is setup at three different angles, and for each we measure the volume that flows out of the tube over a set time interval. The slope determines the hydraulic gradient, and different slopes should yield different flow rates. Figure 23: a) Photo of simple Darcy Tube and b) diagram showing terms in Darcy’s Law Equation Step 1. Fill the tube with your porous material, set it up at your desired angle, make sure your hose outlet is in the place and then turn on the tap to let water run through it at a rate that means your water level at the top of your tube remains constant (steady state). Step 2. Measure the volume of water that comes out of your tube over a set time and record your data in Table 9. Step 3. From these data you can calculate the hydraulic conductivity (\\(K\\)) of each material. What equation will you use to do this? What are the units? Step 4. Plot a figure to show the relationship between hydraulic gradient and volumetric flow rate (\\(Q\\)) for each material. Make sure you clearly label both axes and show units. Adjust the axes scale if needed to better fit your data. If you are wanting to compare data sets, it is easiest to do this if you plot them as multiple series on the one chart. Step 5. Are you results what you would expect given theory of groundwater flow outlined above? If not, why do you think that might be the case? Are there any improvements you think should be made to the experimental design? td { height: 30px } Table 9: Darcy tube calculations. Material Hydraulic gradient (-) Time (min) Volume of water (mL) Hydraulic conductivity (\\(m/d\\)) Physical model of groundwater system In this part of the exercise we will look at a model of a layered groundwater system. Each layer has a different hydraulic conductivity, \\(K\\), forming two aquifers and an aquitard. Within each layer there will also be variation in hydraulic conductivity. This spatial variation is called “heterogeneity”, and it is an important feature of real groundwater systems. Step 1. Annotate the photo of this model (Figure 24) to show the following; Aquifers and aquitards Recharge and discharge zones Water levels in each of the wells The water table Hydraulic head boundaries Figure 24: Physical model of a layered groundwater system. Step 2. Now let’s inject a dye to see how fast the water is moving and in which direction. Measure the distance travelled by the centre of mass of the dye over a fixed time interval to determine the rate of groundwater flow. What have you just measured, the specific discharge \\(q\\), or the groundwater velocity \\(\\bar{v}\\)? Step 3. For a given head-gradient (i.e. water table slope; \\(H2-H1\\)), measure water leaving the central “river” (\\(V\\)) over a defined interval (\\(t\\)). Use Darcy’s Law to back-calculate the Hydraulic Conductivity, \\(K\\), noting that: \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{V}{t} = Q = -KA \\frac{H2-H1}{L} \\tag{13} \\end{equation}\\] Step 4. In the same way that a ball will roll down a hill in a direction perpendicular to topographic contours, groundwater flow will be perpendicular to hydraulic head contours. Have a go at drawing the groundwater flow lines (solid lines ending in an arrow) and hydraulic head contours (dashed lines) onto the photo of the physical groundwater model. As a general rule, flow through high conductivity layers will be primarily horizontal, and flow through low conductivity layers will be primarily vertical. Step 5. What have you learnt from this experiment about groundwater systems? By using the physical model we have been able to see directly in the subsurface, but in the real world, the only information we have would be the wells. If you only had the hydraulic head measurements in the wells what would you know about the groundwater system? How important is it that we understand the geology as well as having measurements of hydraulic heads? What else might you measure in a real groundwater system to get a fuller picture of what is happening? Computer model of groundwater system We can also run a “digital twin” of the physical model that we have built in the lab. For this activity we will now use the ParFlow Sandtank model. This is a computer model simulating groundwater flow, and allows users to change aquifer configurations and explore the essential features of groundwater and contaminant flow. Step 1. Once you have watched the introductory video lets take a look at running the model. Navigate to this model website Step 2. Learn how to customise the sandtank and run a simulation here Step 3. Manipulate the soil conditions and the hydraulic head sliders, and run simulations pumping or injecting groundwater. Step 4. Try to reproduce our lab-based physical model. "],

The daily runoff from each sub catchment, \\(Q_i\\) (m3/day), can be simply approximated based on the daily rainfall (\\(R\\)), where \\(c\\) is the daily runoff efficiency and \\(R^{crit}\\) is the initial loss threshold (\\(m\\), this is the amount of rainfall that does not make it to the stream): \\[\\begin{equation} Q_{i}^{t} = \\left\\{\\begin{matrix} 0,\\ \\ &amp;R_{i}^{t}\\le R_{i}^{crit} \\\\ c_{i}(R_{i}^{t}-R_{i}^{crit})A_{i},\\ \\ &amp;R_{i}^{t}&gt; R_{i}^{crit} \\end{matrix}\\right. \\tag{14} \\end{equation}\\] The total flow (\\(Q_{tot}\\), m3/day) is calculated by summing the individual sub catchments, however there is an assumed lag time of 1 day for sub catchment 2 and 2 days lag time for sub catchment 3: \\[\\begin{equation} Q_{tot}^{t} = \\color{#9BBB59}{Q_{1}^{t}} + \\color{#0070C0}{Q_{2}^{t-1}} + \\color{#F79646}{Q_{3}^{t-2}} \\tag{15} \\end{equation}\\] For each sub catchment, the phosphorus concentration, \\(P_{i}\\) (g/m3), depends on how much flow there is (e.g. more flow = more fertilizer leaching) by assuming a simple power law fitted to the flow-concentration relationship computed for each land-use (\\(P\\)~\\(\\alpha Q \\beta\\)). This is averaged over the different land use fractions (denoted with the small \\(p\\) index), using the land-use fraction \\(F_p\\): \\[\\begin{equation} P_{i}^{t} = \\sum_{p=4}^{N_{p}} F_{p}\\left (\\color{#FF0000}{\\alpha_{p} \\left (\\frac{Q_{i}^{t}}{A_{i}} \\right )^{\\beta_{p}}+P_{0}} \\right ) \\tag{16} \\end{equation}\\] \\(\\color{#FF0000}{\\alpha_{p} \\left (\\frac{Q_{i}^{t}}{A_{i}} \\right )^{\\beta_{p}}+P_{0}}\\) is the flow dependent concentration of the p-th land use type. Where alpha (\\(\\alpha\\)) and beta (\\(\\beta\\)) are variables that govern the stream \\(P_i\\) concentration (g/m3) as a function of area-averaged flow rate (\\(Q/A\\)) and they depend on the dominant land use (\\(p\\)). \\(N_p\\) is the number of land use classes being considered (4) and \\(P_0\\) is the background concentration (g/m3) for that sub-catchment (i.e. the value of PO4 when flow tends to 0). The total \\(P\\) export load is \\(P_{load}\\) (g/day) and is the sum of the different sub catchment outputs (remember load = flow x concentration) with the assumed lag time: \\[\\begin{equation} P_{load}^{t} = \\color{#9BBB59}{P_{1}^{t} Q_{1}^{t}} + \\color{#0070C0}{P_{2}^{t-1} Q_{2}^{t-1}} + \\color{#F79646}{P_{3}^{t-2} Q_{3}^{t-2}} \\tag{17} \\end{equation}\\] Module Resources Download the Excel spreadsheet for this exercise by clicking the download button in the tool bar . Exercises Building the model Draw by hand the conceptual model of this system. Confirm with the person beside you what index means (\\(t\\), \\(i\\), \\(p\\)). Build the above model to predict the individual sub catchment flows and basin total flow. Assume basic information as outlined in Table 10 below and supplied rainfall data for the 3 catchments. Input a value for \\(c\\) within the range given for now. Table 10: Parameters for the individual catchments. Parameters for catchment model: Sub Catchment 1 (\\(i\\)=1) Sub Catchment 2 (\\(i\\)=2) Sub catchment 3 (\\(i\\)=3) Sub catchment area, \\(A\\) (km2) 50 100 120 Runoff coefficient, \\(c\\) (range) 0.2 to 0.5 0.1 to 0.4 0.1 to 0.3 Initial loss threshold value, \\(R_{crit}\\) (m) 0.01 0.025 0.04 Landuse fraction, \\(F\\): irrigated dairy 0.1 0 0.5 Landuse fraction, \\(F\\): wheat 0 0.8 0.1 Landuse fraction, \\(F\\): urban 0.3 0 0.1 Landuse fraction, \\(F\\): forest 0.6 0.2 0.3 Calibrating the model Let’s make sure the model flows are realistic: Manually adjust the runoff coefficient values (\\(c\\)) for each sub catchment (see possible ranges in table below) until the model best matches the observed data. This processed is called “calibration”. Check this by using a regression plot of the given total observed runoff and the model total runoff, checking to get the highest R2 value Calculate phosphate concentrations Now let’s work out the land-use specific stream \\(P\\) concentrations: Predict the sub catchment river \\(P\\) concentrations and total river basin \\(P\\) export load. The best way to do this is first predict the \\(P\\) concentration of each land-use class (\\(F_p\\)) in each sub catchment each as a column (i.e. Dairy \\(P\\) concentration, Wheat \\(P\\) concentration and so on), and then sum the 4 columns for \\(P_i\\). Table 11: Phosphate parameters. Parameters for P concentration: \\(\\alpha\\) (alpha) \\(\\beta\\) (beta) Landuse parameters: irrigated dairy (\\(p\\)=1) 0.10 0.10 Landuse parameters: wheat (\\(p\\)=2) 0.05 0.15 Landuse parameters: urban (\\(p\\)=3) 0.06 0.15 Landuse parameters: forest (\\(p\\)=4) 0.02 0.08 See how dairy has the highest alpha? This means it produces the most \\(P\\) of all 4 classes. Consider 2 management scenarios Finally, let’s run 2 management scenarios: Scenario 1: If the total urban area in each sub catchment expands to 50% (0.5), how would this affect the overall \\(P\\) export? Change the land use fractions manually. They still have to add up to 1, so change the other parts as you see appropriate, i.e. urban area usually comes at the expense of forest, but you can decide how to change the landscape. Record your changed fractions. Scenario 2 If the irrigated dairy industry were made to contain their flows (i.e. prevent high \\(P\\) concentrations going to the stream), how would this affect the overall concentration in the water at the river basin outlet? They have to keep the total subcatchment \\(P\\) concentration below 0.065 g m3. Use an IF statement. "],
